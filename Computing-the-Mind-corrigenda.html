<h1>Corrigenda for <I>Computing the Mind</I></h1>

<B>August 28, 2008: good news!</B> For those of you who have faulty copies
 from the first printing (with missing images): Oxford University Press will
 replace them.
<P>
<font color=red><B>October 20, 2008: bad news!</B></font> The second printing is <B>not</B> error-free:
OUP managed to screw it up again by leaving out some more stuff that had been present
 in the galley proofs. These additional errors are <font color=red>flagged
 in red</font> in the table below.
<P>

<B>NOTE:</B> if you find an error that is not listed here, please <a
