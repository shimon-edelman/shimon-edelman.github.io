<h3>Buddha's <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/zen/">Zen</a>.</h3>

<P class="colp">
Buddha said: `I consider the positions of kings and rulers as that of
dust motes. I observe treasures of gold and gems as so many bricks and
pebbles. I look upon the finest silken robes as tattered rags. I see
myriad worlds of the universe as small seeds of fruit, and the
greatest lake in India as a drop of oil on my foot. I perceive the
teachings of the world to be the illusion of magicians. I discern the
highest conception of emancipation as a golden brocade in a dream, and
view the holy path of the illuminated ones as flowers appearing in
one's eyes. I see meditation as a pillar of a mountain, Nirvana as a
nightmare of daytime. I look upon the judgement of right and wrong as
the serpentine dance of a dragon, and the rise and fall of beliefs as
but traces left by the four seasons.'
