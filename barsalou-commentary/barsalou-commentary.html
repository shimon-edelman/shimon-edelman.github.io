<B>Abstract.</B> <I>Representational systems need to employ symbols
  as internal stand-ins for distal quantities and events. Barsalou's
  ideas go a long way towards making the symbol system theory of
  representation more appealing, by delegating one critical part of
  the representational burden -- dealing with the constituents of
  compound structures -- to image-like entities. The target paper,
  however, leaves the other critical component of any symbol system
  theory -- the compositional ability to bind the constituents
  together -- underspecified. We point out that the binding problem
  can be alleviated if a perceptual symbol system is made to rely on
  image-like entities not only for grounding the constituent symbols,
  but also for composing these into structures.</I>

<P>
Supposing the symbol system postulated by Barsalou is perceptual
through and through -- what then? The target article outlines an
intriguing and exciting theory of cognition in which (1)
well-specified, event- or object-linked percepts assume the role
traditionally allotted to abstract and arbitrary symbols, and (2)
perceptual simulation is substituted for processes traditionally
believed to require symbol manipulation, such as deductive reasoning.
We take a more extreme stance on the role of perception (in
particular, vision) in shaping cognition, and propose, in addition to
Barsalou's postulates, that (3) <EM>spatial</EM> frames, endowed with a
perceptual structure not unlike that of the retinotopic space, pervade
all sensory modalities and are used to support compositionality.

<P>
In the target article too, the concept of a frame is invoked as a main
explanatory tool in the discussion of compositionality.  The reader is
even encouraged to think of a frame as a structure with slots where
pointers to things and events can be inserted. This, however, turns
out to be merely a convenient way to visualize an entity borrowed from
Artificial Intelligence: a formal expression in several variables,
each of which needs to be bound to things or events. An analogy
between this use of frames and the second labor of Heracles suggests
itself: opting for perceptual symbols without offering a perceptual
solution to the binding problem is like chopping off the Hydra's heads
without staunching the stumps.

<P>
The good news is that there <EM>is</EM> a perceptually grounded
alternative to abstract frames: spatial (e.g., retinotopic) frames.
The origins of this idea can be traced to a number of sources.  In
vision, it is reminiscent of O'Regan's call to consider the visual
world (which necessarily possesses an apparently two-dimensional
spatial structure) as a kind of external memory [<A
 HREF="barsalou-commentary.html#ORegan92">O'Regan, 1992</A>]. In
language, a model of sentence processing based on spatial data
structures (two-dimensional activation maps) has been proposed a few
years ago [<A
 HREF="barsalou-commentary.html#Miikkulainen93">Miikkulainen, 1993</A>]. In a review of the latter work, one
of us pointed out that the recourse to a spatial substrate in the
processing of temporal structure may lead to a welcome unification of
theories of visual and linguistic representation [<A
 HREF="barsalou-commentary.html#Edelman94c">Edelman, 1994</A>]. 

<P>
From the computational standpoint, such unification could be based on
two related principles. The first of these is <EM>grounding the
symbols</EM> [<A
 HREF="barsalou-commentary.html#Harnad90">Harnad, 1990</A>] in the external reality; this can be done by
imparting to the symbols some structure that would both help to
disambiguate their referents and help manipulate the symbols to
simulate the manipulation of the referent objects. This principle is
already incorporated into Barsalou's theory (cf. his figure&nbsp;6). The
second principle, which is seen to be a generalization of the first
one, is <EM>grounding the structures</EM> built of symbols. 

<P>
In the case of vision, structures (that is, scene descriptors) can be
naturally grounded in their distal counterparts (scenes), simply by
the representing the scene internally in a spatial data structure (as
envisaged by O'Regan). This can be done by ``spreading'' the
perceptual symbols throughout the visual field, so that in the
representation (as in the world it reflects) each thing is placed
literally where it belongs. To keep down the hardware costs, the
system may use channel coding [<A
 HREF="barsalou-commentary.html#SnippeKoenderink92">Snippe and Koenderink, 1992</A>] (i.e.,
represent the event ``object&nbsp;<I>A</I> at location&nbsp;<I>L</I>'' by a superposition
of a few events of the form ``object&nbsp;<I>A</I> at location&nbsp;<I>L</I><SUB><I>i</I></SUB>'').

<P>
In the case of language, structures do not seem to have anything like
a natural grounding in any kind of spatial structure (not counting the
parse trees that linguists of a certain persuasion like to draw on
two-dimensional surfaces). We conjecture, however, that such a
grounding is conceivable, and can be used both for representing and
manipulating semantic spaces, and for holding syntactic structures in
memory (which needs then to be merely a replica, or perhaps a shared
part, of the visual scene memory). To support this conjecture, one may
look for a ``grammar'' of spatial relations that would mirror all the
requisite theoretical constructs invented by linguists for their
purposes (the ``syntactic'' approach to vision, popular for a brief
time in the 1980's, may have remained barren because it aimed to
explain vision in terms of language, and not vice versa).
Alternatively, it may be preferable to aim at demonstrating
performance based on our idea (e.g., by implementing a version of
Barsalou's system in which spatial buffers would play the role of the
frames), rather than to argue futilely about theories of competence.

<P>
In neurobiology, perhaps the best piece of evidence for a perceptual
symbol system of the sort proposed by Barsalou is provided by the
phantom limb phenomena [<A
 HREF="barsalou-commentary.html#RamachandranHirstein98">Ramachandran and Hirstein, 1998</A>]. These can set in
very rapidly [<A
 HREF="barsalou-commentary.html#BorsookEtAl98">Borsook et al., 1998</A>], are known to occur in congenitally
limb deficient or early childhood amputees [<A
 HREF="barsalou-commentary.html#MelzackEtAl97">Melzack et al., 1997</A>], and
may even be induced in normal subjects [<A
 HREF="barsalou-commentary.html#RamachandranHirstein98">Ramachandran and Hirstein, 1998</A>].
In a beautiful experiment, Ramachandran and Rogers-Ramachandran (1996)
 superimposed a mirror image of the
intact arms of amputees onto the space occupied by a phantom arm, and
found that movements of the mirrored intact hand produced
corresponding kinesthetic sensations in the phantom hand, even in a
subject who had not experienced feelings of movement in his phantom
hand for some ten years prior to testing.  Likewise, touching of the
intact mirrored hand produced corresponding, well-localized touch
sensations in the phantom hand.  These findings support the idea of
the world -- somatosensory, as well as visual -- serving as an
external memory [<A
 HREF="barsalou-commentary.html#ORegan92">O'Regan, 1992</A>], and suggest a stronger relationship
between visuospatial and tactile/proprioceptive representations of
``body space'' for normal subjects. Interestingly, these
representations may be linked, in turn, to the mental lexicon:
electromyogram (EMG) responses to words with semantic content relating
to pain were found to be significantly different in the stumps of
amputees with chronic phantom limb pain, compared to the EMG in the
intact contralateral limb in the same subjects [<A
 HREF="barsalou-commentary.html#LarbigEtAl96">Larbig et al., 1996</A>].
Finally, the phantom phenomenon is not limited to the percept of
``body space'' but may also be demonstrated in other modalities,
notably, in the auditory system [<A
 HREF="barsalou-commentary.html#MuhlnickelEtAl98">Muhlnickel et al., 1998</A>]. All this
suggests that perceptual symbols, along with a spatial frame provided
by the experience of the external world, may (1) solve the symbol
grounding problem and (2) circumvent the binding problem -- two
apparently not immortal heads of the Hydra that besets symbolic
theories of knowledge representation.
