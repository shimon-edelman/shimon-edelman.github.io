<h1>a duelog on the cognitive relevance of generative syntax</h1>

<img src="Duel.gif" align=right>
This USED TO BE a verbatim report of a dialogue between a colleague (a
 generative syntactician) and myself (an experimental epistemologist). The
 debate has been sparked by my remark concerning the cognitive (ir)relevance
 of a conference on generative syntax.
<P>
THE TEXT OF THE EXCHANGE HAS BEEN REMOVED by my colleague's request.
