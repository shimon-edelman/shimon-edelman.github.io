<h3>Seminar description</h3>

<P width=300>
New technologies are changing our world at a rapid pace. In many
cases, the society does not fully understand the impact of technology
and is not prepared for the speed of the change that is
occurring. This seminar will explore a few of these new technologies
and investigate their effects on the users and on the society at
large. The topics that will be explored include face recognition,
virtual reality, violence in media, general AI, and the technological
singularity. We will look at the ways in which these technologies
affect our lives, with a focus on education, entertainment,
employment, politics, and the future of humanity.

<B>Goals:</B>
<ol>
  <li>
    To understand the impact of current technologies and their
    ethical implications. 
  </li>
  <li>
    To evaluate the future of these technologies and discuss how we
    might prepare for them. 
  </li>
  <li>
    To explore the potential repercussions of AI

<h3>The motivation: determinants and dynamics of (un)happiness</h3>
<a name="intro">

<P width=300>
Our present understanding of how the mind works and how minds evolve
 suggests that the pursuit of happiness is a basic human right in a deeper
 sense than warranted by the Declaration of Independence: our capacity for
 moment-to-moment emotional well-being and our ability to appreciate life as
 a whole are both rooted deep in the human nature.  The  human potential for
 happiness cannot, however, be realized if circumstances  oppose it. Indeed,
 contrary to the popular myth of the happy pauper, studies show that
 widespread chronic financial hardship and insecurity and the inequality in
 power and wealth distribution — two chronic aspects of American
 socioeconomic malaise that the Great Recession has greatly exacerbated —
 are both detrimental to happiness.
</P>

<P width=300>
A reflection on the dynamics of this predicament indicates that it may
be self-reinforcing. A panoply of factors act not just to preserve the
status quo, but to deepen the existing divides. Some of these factors
are psychological. For instance, research findings show that
inequality is associated both with increased illusory self-enhancement
and with increased system justification, which in turn help perpetuate
inequality. Moreover, both attention to in-group/out-group
distinctions and the possession of personal power over others
strengthen the perception of "the other" as less human, which may
reduce the motivation of those in power to share it more equitably.
</P>

<P width=300>
Other factors acting to preserve or exacerbate a skewed distribution
of power are political. Corporate control of the media, the unbridled
influence of private money on the machinery of democracy, and the
continued attacks on science and erosion of public education all
ensure that the society's attention is diverted away from the root
causes of its ills.  Instead of being encouraged to think, the average
consumer of the news, increasingly deprived through the lack of
education of cognitive tools for critical analysis, is lured into
acquiescence with the status quo by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspeak"
 target=new>Newspeak</a>-like memes, which pretend 
that freedom to die from lack of health insurance is the epitome of
freedom, or that everyone in this country can "make it" if only they
work hard enough.
</P>

<P width=300>
In this seminar, we shall read and discuss a selection of academic
papers that examine the cognitive, social, and political psychology of
the American polity, with a particular stress on understanding the
dynamics of socioeconomic inequality and on identifying possible ways,
if any, of bringing about change to the better.

  Whether or not you're presenting in a given week, please come prepared
  with questions or comments regarding the readings. 
  </li>
  <li>
  Participate in <B>three</B> separate weekly presentations. Each
  presentation/discussion will be led by a team of three or four students.
  The presenters should be ready for clarification questions and
  interruptions at any time during the presentation.
  <P>
  <B>IMPORTANT:</B> please choose your three topics and co-presenters
  ASAP and no later than the second Monday of the semester (January

  presentation
  slots, <B><font color=red>follow <a href="http://www.signupgenius.com/go/10c0c4ea9a92fa2fb6-psychology" 
  target=signup>this link</a></font></B>.
  <P>
    For an academic paper, a typical presentation should include
  <ul>
    <li>
    a brief introduction to the theme and an overview of the background to
    each paper and its methodology;
    </li>
    <li>
    the findings, as illustrated by the plots or (in the absence of
    graphics) by a concise verbal description;
    </li>
    <li>
    a critique of the paper's approach;
    </li>
    <li>
    a summary of the paper's conclusions and their significance for the
    weekly theme and for the seminar's topic at large.
    </li>
    For other readings, a summary of main points will suffice. In each
    case, the main role of the presenter is to facilitate and steer
    the discussion, not to lecture on the material.
  </ul>
  The presenting teams are required to meet with the instructors ahead of
  their presentation, to address any questions and coordinate the details.
  </li>
  <P>
  <li>
    On weeks you're not presenting, please submit (via the Blackboard
    discussion page) a brief opinion / question on the readings. Give
    it an informative title, including week number.

    For the last meeting, please prepare (and send to the instructors)
  a written summary of your  impressions and lessons from the seminar,
    in a short-essay form (~ 1000 words). 
  </li>

<h3>Inclusion and diversity:</h3>
<a name="inclusion">

[The remarks in this section, which are specific to this course, are
intended to supplement the official Cornell statement on diversity and
inclusion, which covers dimensions such as gender, race,
socio-economic background, etc., and which can be
found <a href="http://diversity.cornell.edu/" target=d>here</a>.]

<P>
Unlike in a large-enrollment lecture-based course, in which some
students may choose, and succeed, to remain virtually anonymous, in a
small-class seminar setting you are required to speak in front of the
class (when presenting) and are expected to contribute to the
discussion on other occasions. Because <I>your</I> informed opinion on
every aspect of the material is unique and valuable, we shall strive
to facilitate the conversation so as to make all voices heard. In
this, we'll be counting on your help, and on the help of your
classmates.
</P>
<P>
Even matters of "consensus" are not always easy to talk about, as the
rare dissenters who dare voice their opposition know full well; how
then should we approach potentially controversial topics? With care
and compassion, diligence, openness, and daring: care for our shared
humanity; diligence with regard to the relevant knowledge and
findings; openness to informed dissent; and daring to venture into
uncharted territory, as befits good education.
</P>
<P>
If at any point during the semester (no matter whether in class or
after hours) you feel that you need to talk about any of these things,
please let us know immediately --- doing so will be our top priority.
</P>
  

<HR>

<P>
<B>Students with Disabilities:</B> please give us your Student
Disability Services (SDS) accommodation letter early in the semester
so that we have adequate time to arrange your approved academic
modifications. Meeting with us during our office hours will help ensure
confidentiality. If you need an immediate accommodation for equal
access, please speak with us after class or send an email message to
us and/or SDS
at <a href="mailto:sds_cu@cornell.edu">sds_cu@cornell.edu</a>. If the
need arises for additional accommodations during the semester, please
contact SDS.
