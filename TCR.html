    This book is about all things consciousness, great and small. It
    starts by pointing to the key characteristic of consciousness,
    without realizing which it cannot be understood: like everything
    else about the mind, it is fundamentally a kind of computation.
    Among many other matters, this explains: how it is that we share
    some aspects of consciousness with bacteria; how it can arise in
    artificial machines and not just living ones; how the empty cocoon
    of the self that it spins ends up pretending to be the butterfly;
    and how consciousness dooms this virtual butterfly to the splendor
    and the suffering of being awake and aware. Unlike most other
    books on consciousness, this one includes a discussion of some
    possible ways whereby we, pinned like butterflies by our species’
    history and socioeconomic circumstances, can awake to our
    collective predicament and join forces to do something about
    it. It should be of interest to all readers who care about the
    nature of our lived experience — and about our survival, which
    depends on developing critical consciousness of our dire situation
    and the social dynamics that shapes it.
