<B>Abstract.</B> The theoretical debate in linguistics over the past
 half-century bears
an uncanny parallel to the politics of the (now defunct) Communist
Bloc. The parallels are not so much in the revolutionary nature of
Chomsky's ideas as in the Bolshevik manner of his takeover of
linguistics [<A
 HREF="http://kybele.psych.cornell.edu/~edelman/on-Jackendoff/edelman.html#Koerner94">Koerner, 1994</A>] and in the Trotskyist (``permanent
revolution'') flavor of the subsequent development of the doctrine of
transformational generative grammar (TGG) [<A
 HREF="http://kybele.psych.cornell.edu/~edelman/on-Jackendoff/edelman.html#TownsendBever01">Townsend and Bever, 2001</A>],
pp.37-40.  By those standards, Jackendoff is quite a party faithful (a
Khrushchev or a Dubcek rather than a Solzhenitzyn or a Sakharov) who
questions some of the components of the dogma, yet stops far short of
repudiating it.
</P>
</center>

<P>

<P>
In the <EM>Foundations of Language</EM>, Jackendoff (2002) offers his
version of TGG, in which the primacy of syntax (``an important
mistake'', p.107) is abolished, the related notions of Deep Structure
and Logical Form (``the broken promise''; p.73) are set aside, the
links to other domains of cognition are discussed, and a hand is
extended in peace to psychologists and other cognitive scientists.
<EM>FoL</EM> is an enjoyable, thought-provoking and useful book that
fulfills the promise of its title by presenting - and attempting to
tackle - foundational issues in linguistics. It is an excellent
overview of the ground that must be covered by any serious contender
for a linguistic ``theory of everything''.  Its non-dogmatic style
engages skeptical readers of cognitive and empiricist persuasions
(``can my theory explain this set of facts better?'') instead of
alienating them.

<P>
Among the more positive aspects of Jackendoff's stance in <EM>FoL</EM>
are the emancipation of semantics as one of the three equal-status
components of the ``parallel architecture'' (p.125), the realization
that not all rules are fully productive (admitting constructions;
p.189), and the construal of meaning as a system of conceptual
structures (p.306).  The pervasiveness of TGG dogma is, however, very
prominent throughout the book. On the most abstract level, the dogma
manifests itself in the bizarre mentalistic nomenclature (<EM>f-knowledge</EM>, etc.) that Jackendoff uses instead of the standard
explanatory machinery of representation found in all cognitive
sciences. Jackendoff shuns a representational account of linguistic
knowledge because of his (understandable) wish to avoid joining Fodor
and Searle in the philosophical quagmire of intentionality. There
exist, however, psychophysically and neurobiologically plausible
accounts of symbolic representation that hinge on counterfactual
causality and manage to stay clear of the Fodorian mire

 HREF="http://kybele.psych.cornell.edu/~edelman/on-Jackendoff/edelman.html#Clark00">Clark, 2000</A>].

<P>
The preponderance of Chomskian bricks in the <EM>Foundations of
Language</EM> is revealed in Jackendoff's official insistence, in the
introductory chapters, on rule-based combinatoriality. The initial
formulation of this concept (pp.38-57) is so strong as to be
incompatible with his own views on constructions (pp.152-187) and on
their graded entrenchment (p.189), expressed later in the book. It is
satisfying to observe that those latter views are on a convergence
course with some of the best-known and most promising work in
cognitive linguistics [<A
 HREF="http://kybele.psych.cornell.edu/~edelman/on-Jackendoff/edelman.html#Langacker87">Langacker, 1987</A>,<A
 HREF="http://kybele.psych.cornell.edu/~edelman/on-Jackendoff/edelman.html#Goldberg98">Goldberg, 1998</A>]. As such, they can
stand on their own: computationally explicit construction-based
accounts of linguistic productivity need no extra propping
[<A
 HREF="http://kybele.psych.cornell.edu/~edelman/on-Jackendoff/edelman.html#SolanEtAl03cogsci">Solan et&nbsp;al., 2003</A>].  In any case, Jackendoff should not count on
any help from TGG, a Protean theory that despite decades of effort
failed to garner empirical support for the psychological reality of
the processes and entities postulated by its successive versions, such
as movement and traces [<A
 HREF="http://kybele.psych.cornell.edu/~edelman/on-Jackendoff/edelman.html#EdelmanChristiansen03">Edelman and Christiansen, 2003</A>,<A
 HREF="http://kybele.psych.cornell.edu/~edelman/on-Jackendoff/edelman.html#Edelman03tics">Edelman, 2003</A>].  In
a recent attempt to obtain psycholinguistic evidence for traces, for
example [<A
 HREF="http://kybele.psych.cornell.edu/~edelman/on-Jackendoff/edelman.html#NakanoFelserClahsen02">Nakano et&nbsp;al., 2002</A>], only 24 subjects out of the
original 80 performed consistently with the predictions of a
trace/movement theory, while 39 subjects exhibited the opposite
behavior (the data from the rest of the subjects were discarded
because their error rate was too high). Jackendoff's continuing
clinging to TGG (complete with movement and traces), despite its
empirical bankruptcy and despite his self-proclaimed openness to
reform, is difficult to explain.

<P>
Even Jackendoff's highly commendable effort to treat semantics
seriously may be undermined by his continuing commitment to
TGG. Conceptualist semantics is an exciting idea, but to develop it
fully one must listen to what cognitive psychologists have to say
about the nature of concepts. Instead, Jackendoff erects his own
theory of concepts around a scaffolding left by the generative
linguists, which, in turn, is only as sound as those decades-old
intuitions of Chomsky and Fodor. In particular, incorporating Marr's
and Biederman's theories of visual structure (pp.346-347), themselves
patterned on TGG-style syntax, into the foundations of semantics
cannot be a good idea. Jackendoff's acknowledgment, in a footnote on
p.347, that Marr is ``out of fashion'' with the vision community holds
a key to a resolution of this issue: current perceptually grounded
theories of visual [<A
 HREF="http://kybele.psych.cornell.edu/~edelman/on-Jackendoff/edelman.html#Edelman99book">Edelman, 1999</A>,<A
 HREF="http://kybele.psych.cornell.edu/~edelman/on-Jackendoff/edelman.html#Edelman02tics">Edelman, 2002</A>] and other
[<A
 HREF="http://kybele.psych.cornell.edu/~edelman/on-Jackendoff/edelman.html#Barsalou99">Barsalou, 1999</A>] concepts are a safe, additive-free alternative to
TGG-style semantics.

<P>
In summary, Jackendoff's book is one of several recent manifestations
in linguistics of the equivalent of the Prague Spring of 1968, when
calls for putting a human face on Soviet-style ``socialism'' began to
be heard (cf. the longing for ``linguistics with a human face''
expressed by [<A
 HREF="http://kybele.psych.cornell.edu/~edelman/on-Jackendoff/edelman.html#Werth99">Werth, 1999</A>], p.18). Jackendoff's stance, according to
which the ``mistakes'' that were made do not invalidate the TGG
framework, amounts to a bid to change the system from within. In a
totalitarian political system, this may only work if the prime mover
behind the change is at the very top of the power pyramid:
Czechoslovakia's Dubcek in 1968 merely brought the Russian tanks to
the streets of Prague, whereas Russia's Gorbachev in 1987 succeeded in
dismantling the tyranny that had sent in the tanks. In generative
linguistics, it may be too late for any further attempts to change the
system from within, seeing that previous rounds of
management-initiated reforms did little more than lead the field in
circles [<A
 HREF="http://kybele.psych.cornell.edu/~edelman/on-Jackendoff/edelman.html#EdelmanChristiansen03">Edelman and Christiansen, 2003</A>]. If so, transformational
generative grammar, whose foundations Jackendoff ventures to repair,
may have to follow the fate of the Communist Bloc to clear the way for
real progress in understanding language and the brain.
