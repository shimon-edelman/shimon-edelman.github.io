<B>SNAFU, FUBAR</B>

Situation normal, democracy fucked up beyond all recognition
Plutocrats thrive, the unemployed watch in quiet desperation
Wall Street rules, riot cops break up peaceful demonstrations
Money buys pols, judges fig-leaf the rule of corporations

Situation normal, cash-strapped schools bleed drugs and frustration
Corporate bosses like to have their grunts fear, shun education
Crooked clerics preach humility now, later salvation
Voters brainwashed, good consumers all, an obedient nation

Situation normal, perpetual war in every generation
Children are born, grow up, and die under occupation
Rockets rain from the sky on civilian population
Talking heads spew patriotic hogwash amid the devastation.
