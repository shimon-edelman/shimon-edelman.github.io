You yourself are an orphan,           a black sheep, a pariah, an outlaw.       To your name not a penny. Out of your maw —         frozen breath in the shape of a dragon.       Better pray out loud, like a new Nazarene,            for the bearers of gifts in both       halves of the earth, self-proclaimed kings,           and for every child in a cradle.                                   Joseph Brodsky, 1986                                   [original <a href="http://theatrefenix.narod.ru/N_Y/Brodskiy.html" target=new>here</a>]</PRE><hr><address>translated by <a href="http://kybele.psych.cornell.edu/~edelman">Shimon Edelman &lt;se37@cornell.edu&gt;</a></address><P><a href="http://kybele.psych.cornell.edu/~edelman/poetry">[back]</a><P><script type="text/javascript">var gaJsHost = (("https:" == document.location.protocol) ?
