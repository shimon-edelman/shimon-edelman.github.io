<h2>Are you the end</h2>

<pre>

So then, are you the end? But the air is still clear,
The mists of existence beckon still from afar,
And the sky is still blue and so bright is the star
At the end of the year.

I with peace in my heart greet my verdict at last,
For my sunsets were red and my sunrise was bright,
And my footpath was marked by the flowers that smiled
As I passed.
