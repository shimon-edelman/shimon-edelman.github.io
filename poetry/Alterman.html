<h2>the dead men's thoughts</h2>

<pre>
[...]
For divided the world is, and twofold
is the murmur of its regret;
every home has its dead to grieve for,
and the dead their home won't forget.

In our cities, the realm of dejection,
by the dwellers of darkness observed,
our wonderful life to perfection
is suffused by the thoughts of the dead.
