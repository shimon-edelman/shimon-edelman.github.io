    What is the cause of bird migration? Or more specifically: Why did
    the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warbler"
	   target=new>warbler</a> in my summer place in
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hampshire"
       target=new>New Hampshire</a> start his southward migration on the
    night of the 25th of August?
  </P>
  <OL>
    <li>
      <I>An ecological cause.</I> The warbler, being an insect
      eater, must migrate, because it would starve to death if it
      should try to winter in New Hampshire.
    </li>
    <li>
      <I>A genetic cause.</I> The warbler has acquired a genetic
      constitution in the course of the evolutionary history of its
      species which induces it to respond appropriately to the
      proper stimuli from the environment. On the other hand, the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screech_owl"
	 target=new>screech owl</a>, nesting right next to it, lacks
      this constitution and does not respond to these stimuli. As a
      result, it is sedentary.
    </li>
    <li>
      <I>An intrinsic physiological cause.</I>  The warbler flew
      south because its migration is tied in with
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circadian_rhythm"
	 target=new>photoperiodicity</a>. It responds to the decrease
      in day length and is ready to migrate as soon as the number of
      hours of daylight have dropped below a certain level.
    </li>
    <li>
      <I>An extrinsic physiological cause.</I>  Finally, the warbler
      migrated on the 25th of August because a cold air mass, with
      northerly winds, passed over our area on that day. The sudden
      drop in temperature and the associated weather conditions
      affected the bird, already in a general physiological
      readiness for migration, so that it actually took off on that
      particular day.
    </li>

  <UL class="outline">
    <li><B><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximate_and_ultimate_causation"
	   target=new>Proximate vs. ultimate</a> causes</B>. If we look
	   over the four causations of the migration of this bird once
	   more we can readily see that there is an immediate set of
	   causes of the migration, which we might call PROXIMATE.
      <ul>
	<li>the physiological condition of the bird</li>
	<li>photoperiodicity and drop in temperature</li>
      </ul>
      The other two are the ULTIMATE causes.
      <ul>
	<li>the lack of food during winter</li>
	<li>the genetic disposition of the bird</li>
      </ul>
      These are causes that have a history and that have been
      incorporated into the system through many thousands of
      generations of natural selection. [...]  The functional
      biologist would be concerned with analysis of the proximate
      causes, while the evolutionary biologist — with analysis of the
      ultimate causes.
    </li>
    <li><B>Prediction and indeterminacy in biology.</B>  In the
      classical theory of causality the touchstone of the goodness of
      a causal explanation was its predictive value.
      <ul>
	<li>
	  Bunge's modern classic: "A theory can predict to the
	  extent to which it can describe and explain."
	</li>
	<li>
	  It is evident that Bunge is a physicist; no biologist would
	  have made such a statement. The theory of natural selection
	  can describe and explain phenomena with considerable
	  precision, but it cannot make reliable predictions, except
	  through such trivial and meaningless circular statements as,
	  for instance: "the fitter individuals will on the average
	  leave more offspring."
	</li>
	<li>
	  Probably nothing in biology is less predictable than the
	  future course of evolution. Looking at the
	  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permian"
	  target=new>Permian reptiles</a>, who would have predicted
	  that most of the more flourishing groups would
	  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permian%E2%80%93Triassic_extinction_event"
	  target=new>become extinct</a> (many rather rapidly), and that
	  one of the most undistinguished branches would give rise to
	  the mammals?
	</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><B>Reasons for indeterminacy in biology.</B>
      <ul>
	<li>Randomness of an event with respect to the significance of
	  the event.</li>
	<li>Uniqueness of all entities at the
	  higher levels of biological integration.</li>
	<li>Extreme complexity.</li>
	<li>Emergence of new qualities at

    <I>(b) Constructive development.</I> By contrast, in the EES,
    genes and genomes represent one of many resources that contribute
    to the developing phenotype. Causation flows both upwards from
    lower levels of biological organization, such as DNA, and from
    higher levels downwards, such as through tissue- and
    environment-specific gene regulation. Exploratory and selective
    processes are important sources of novel and evolutionarily
    significant phenotypic variation. Rather than containing a
    ‘program’, the genome represents a component of the developmental
    system, shaped by evolution to sense and respond to relevant
    signals and to provide materials upon which cells can draw.

  <h1>some conclusions</h1>

  <P>
    "A further benefit [of EES] comes from strengthening ties to
    adjacent disciplines, such as ecology [76,143,144], or the human
    sciences, including archaeology, biological anthropology,
    developmental psychology, <B>epidemiology, and economics</B>
    [145–150], where some of these ideas are already starting to have an
    impact.
  </P>
  <P>
    Moreover, other advances in biology potentially take on new
    significance within the EES. For instance, the emphasis on inclusive
    inheritance potentially gives
    <a href"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_selection#Multilevel_selection_theory"
       target=new><I><B>multi-level selection</B></I></a> even greater
    significance, as selection can operate on all forms of heritable
    variation.
  </P>
  <P>
    <font color=gray>
      Another case is
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome_evolution"
	 target=new><I>genome evolution</I></a>, where horizontal gene
	 transfer
	 in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prokaryote"
	 target=new>prokaryotes</a>, and genetic transfer from
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endosymbiont"
	 target=new>endosymbionts</a>
	 in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eukaryote"
	 target=new>eukaryotes</a> [151], can be understood as part of
	 a broader suite of phenomena with the propensity to propagate
	 horizontally (e.g. social transmission, ecological
	 inheritance).  The recognition that genome change is an
	 active cell-mediated physiological process that responds to
	 challenging life-history events [152] fits neatly with the
	 EES’s treatment of
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotypic_plasticity"
	 target=new>plasticity</a>.
    </font>
  </P>
  <P>
    The EES perspective may also facilitate implementation of
    approaches from computer science that enable mathematical
    representation of complex dynamic systems, such as connectionist
    models of memory and learning applied to model
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"
       target=new>genotype</a>
    to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"

      "Two aspects of animal life impressed
      <a href="https://theanarchistlibrary.org/category/author/petr-kropotkin"
      target=new>me</a> most during the
      journeys which I made in my youth in Eastern Siberia and
      Northern Manchuria. One of them was the extreme severity of the
      struggle for existence which most species of animals have to
      carry on against an inclement Nature; the enormous destruction
      of life which periodically results from natural agencies; and
      the consequent paucity of life over the vast territory which
      fell under my observation. And the other was, that even in those
      few spots where animal life teemed in abundance, I failed to
      find — although I was eagerly looking for it — that bitter
      struggle for the means of existence, among animals belonging to
      the same species, which was considered by most Darwinists
      (though not always by Darwin himself) as the dominant
      characteristic of struggle for life, and the main factor of
      evolution."
