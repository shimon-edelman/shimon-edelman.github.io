  <h1>an agent-based computational model of civil violence</h1>

  <P>
    Two variants of the civil violence model are presented:
    <ol>
      <li>
	A central authority seeks to suppress decentralized
	rebellion.
	<P>
	  "Where I use the term “revolution,” I do so advisedly,
	  recognizing that no political or social order is represented
	  in the model. Perforce, neither is the overthrow of an
	  existing order, the latter being widely seen as definitive
	  of revolutions properly speaking. The dynamics of
	  decentralized upheaval, rather than its political substance,
	  is the focus here.
	</P>
      </li>
      <li>
	In the second a central authority seeks to suppress communal
	violence between two warring ethnic groups.
	<P>
	  The focus is on "generating certain characteristic phenomena
	  and core dynamics; I do not purport to reconstruct any
	  particular case in detail, although [...] that is an obvious
	  long-term objective."
      </li>
    </ul>

<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>model I: generalized rebellion against central authority</h1>

  <P>
    This model involves two categories of actors. ‘‘Agents’’ are
    members of the general population and may be actively rebellious
    or not. ‘‘Cops’’ are the forces of the central authority, who seek
    out and arrest actively rebellious agents.
  </P>
  <P>
    <B>The Agent Specification.</B> In any model of rebellion there
    must be some representation of political grievance. Here,
    grievance involves only two highly idealized components:
    <ul>
      <li>Hardship, \(H \in [0,1]\), drawn from the uniform
	probability distribution; this differs across agents.
	<P>
	  "Of course, perceived hardship alone does not a revolution
	  make. As noted in the [19th century] Russian revolutionary
	  journal,
	  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narodnaya_Volya"
	  target=new><I>Narodnaya Volya</I></a>, ‘‘No village ever
	  revolted merely because it was hungry’’."
	</P>
      </li>
      <li>
	The perceived legitimacy of the regime, \(L \in [0,1]\); this
	is exogenous and is equal across agents.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <P>
      The level of grievance any agent feels toward the regime is
      defined as \(G = H ( 1 - L ) \).
    </P>
  <P>
    If legitimacy is high, then hardship does not induce political
    grievance. For example, the British government enjoyed
    unchallenged legitimacy \((L = 1)\) during World War II. Hence,
    the extreme hardship produced by
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blitz" target=new>the
    blitz of London</a> did not produce grievance toward the
    government.  By the same token, if people are suffering (high
    \(H\)), then the revelation of government corruption (low \(L\))
    may be expected to produce increased levels of grievance.
  </P>
    
</DIV>




<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>model 1 (cont.)</h1>

  <P>
    An agent's decision to rebel depends not only on grievance but
    also on risk aversion \(R\), drawn from \(U(0,1)\) and fixed for
    the agent’s lifetime. An agent estimates the likelihood of arrest
    before joining a rebellion. The estimate increases with the ratio
    of cops to already rebellious agents within the prospective
    rebel’s field of vision \(v\), the number of lattice positions
    (north, south, east, and west of the agent’s current position)
    that the agent is able to inspect (exogenous and equal across
    agents). As in most agent-based models, vision is limited;
    information is local.
  </P>
  <P>
    Let \((C/A)_v\) be the cop-to-active ratio within \(v\).  The
    agent’s estimated arrest probability \(P = 1 - e^\left(-
    k\left(C/A\right)^v\right)\). Note that \(A\) is always at least
    1, because the agent always counts himself as active when
    computing \(P\). He is asking, ‘‘How likely am I to be arrested if
    I go active?’’ Intuition: Imagine being a deeply aggrieved agent
    considering throwing a rock through a bank window. If there are 10
    cops at the bank window, you are much more likely to be arrested
    if you are the first to throw a rock \((C/A = 10)\) than if you
    show up when there are already 29 rock-throwing agents \((C/A =
    1/3)\).
  </P>
  <P>
    The agent’s net risk is the product of its risk aversion and
    estimated arrest probability: \(N = RP\).  If for an agent in the
    quiet state \(Q\) the difference \(G - N\) exceeds some threshold
    \(T\), then it goes active; otherwise, it stays quiescent. If for
    an agent in the active state \(A\) the difference exceeds \(T\),
    then it stays active; otherwise, it goes quiescent: 
    <DIR><DIR>
      <I>Agent rule A</I>: If \(G - N > T\) be active; otherwise, be quiet.
    </DIR></DIR>
  </P>
  
</DIV>



<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>bounded rationality</h1>

  <P>
    The agent rule can be interpreted as maximizing expected utility,
    such that \(G - N\) is the utility of publicly expressing one’s
    private grievance, and \(T\) is the utility of not expressing it.
  </P>
  <P>
    \(T\) is typically set at some small positive value.  Note,
    however, that if it takes negative values, like \(-G\) (i.e., the
    frustration level equals the grievance level itself), agents may
    find it rational to rebel knowing that they will suffer negative
    utility.  It’s simply worse to ‘‘sit and take it anymore.’’
  </P>
  <P>
    Agents weigh expected costs and benefits, but their
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounded_rationality"
    target=new>rationality is bounded</a>. One might say that
    individual rationality is ‘‘local’’ also, in the sense that the
    agent’s expected utility calculation excludes any estimate of how
    his isolated act of rebellion may affect the social order. Very
    importantly, deterrence is local in this model and depends on the
    local (individually visible) — not the global — ratio of cops to
    actives, which is highly dynamic in this spatial model with
    movement.
  </P>
  
</DIV>



<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>the cop specification</h1>

  <P>
    The cops are much simpler than prospective rebels. Their
    attributes are as follows: \(v^*\), the cop vision, is the number
    of lattice positions (north, south, east, and west of the cop’s
    current position) that the cop is able to inspect. It is exogenous
    and equal across cops. It need not equal the agents’ \(v\), but is
    typically small relative to the lattice size, so it is local too.
  </P>
  <P>
    The cops, like the other agents, have one simple rule of behavior:
    <DIR><DIR>
	<P>
	  <I>Cop rule C</I>: Inspect all sites within \(v^*\) and arrest
	  a random active agent.
	</P>
	<P>
	  An arrested active is assigned a jail
	  term drawn randomly from \(U(0,J_{max})\).
	</P>
    </DIR></DIR>
  <P>
    Cops never defect to the revolution in this model.
  </P>
  <P>
    The movement is the same for agents and cops:
    <DIR><DIR>
	<I>Movement rule M</I>: Move to a random site within your vision.
    </DIR></DIR>
  </P>    

</DIV>

  
    
<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>graphics</h1>

  <img src="Epstein02-fig1.png" class="figure-right" height=350>
    <P>
      Agents and cops move around the grid space and interact. I am
      interested in the dynamics of grievance and—quite separately—in
      the dynamics of revolutionary action. The point of separating
      these private and public spheres is to permit illustration of a
      core point in all research on this topic: public order may
      prevail despite tremendous private opposition to—feelings of
      grievance toward—a regime.
    </P>
    <P>
      Given this important distinction between private grievance and
      public action, two screens are shown.
    </P>
    <P>
      <I>On the left</I>, agents are colored by their public
      action: <font color=blue>blue</font> if
      quiescent; <font color=red>red</font> if active.
    </P>
    <P>
      <I>On the right</I>,
      agents are colored by their private level of grievance. The
      darker the
      <font color=red>red</font>, the higher the level of
      grievance.
    </P>
    <P>
      Cops are colored black on both screens. Simply to reduce visual
      clutter, all agents and cops are represented as circles on the
      left screen and squares on the right. Unoccupied sites are
      sand-colored on both screens.
    </P>
  
</DIV>




<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>setting the parameters and running the model</h1>

  <img src="Epstein02-tab1.png" height=300>
    <P>
      To begin each run of the model, the user sets \(L, J, v, v^*\),
      and the initial cop and agent densities. To ensure replicability
      of the results, input assumptions for all runs are provided in
      the Table. Agents are assigned random values for \(H\) and
      \(R\), and cops and (initially) quiescent agents are situated in
      random positions on the lattice. The model then simply proceeds
      under the rule set: \(\{A, C, M\}\). An agent or cop is selected
      at random (asynchronous activation) and, under rule \(M\), moves
      to a random site within his vision, where he acts in accord with
      rule \(C\) (if a cop) or \(A\) (if an agent). The model iterates
      this procedure until the user quits or some stipulated state is
      attained.
    </P>
    <P>
      What can one generate in this extremely simple model?
    </P>
  
</DIV>




<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>individual deceptive behavior</h1>

  <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:1937_Mao_Zhou_Qin_in_Yan%27an.jpg" target=new><img src="1937_Mao_Zhou_Qin_in_Yan'an.jpg" class="figure-right"></a>
    <P>
      Despite their simplicity, the agents exhibit unexpected
      deceptive behavior: privately aggrieved agents turn blue (as if
      they were nonrebellious) when cops are near, but then turn red
      (actively rebellious) when cops move away. They are reminiscent
      of Mao’s directive that revolutionaries should ‘‘swim like fish
      in the sea,’’ making themselves indistinguishable from the
      surrounding population ["指挥员在战争的大海中游泳",
      <a href="https://www.marxists.org/chinese/maozedong/marxist.org-chinese-mao-193805b.htm"
      target=new><I>論游擊戰</I></a>, 1938]
    </P>
    <P>
      Ex post facto, the behavior is easily understood: the cop’s
      departure reduces the \(C/A\) ratio within the agent’s vision,
      reducing its estimated arrest probability, and with it its net
      risk, \(N\), all of which pushes \(G-N\) over the agent’s
      activation threshold, and it turns red. Moreover, it would
      probably not have been detected without a spatial visualization;
      individual deception would not be evident in a time series of
      total rebels, for example.
    </P>

<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>free assembly catalyzes rebellious outbursts</h1>

  <img src="Epstein02-fig2.png" class="figure-right" height=350>
    <P>
      With both agents and cops in random motion, it may happen that
      high concentrations of actives arise endogenously in zones of
      low cop density. This can depress local \(C/A\) ratios to such
      low levels that even the mildly aggrieved find it rational to
      join (see figure on the right).
    </P>
    <P>
      Random spatial correlations of activists catalyze local
      outbursts.  This is why freedom of assembly is the first
      casualty of repressive regimes. The mechanism is that local
      activist concentrations reduce local \(C/A\) (cop-to-active)
      ratios, reducing the risk of joining the rebellion. To be the
      first rioter, one must be either very angry or very
      risk-neutral, or both. But to be the 4,000th — if the mob is
      already big, relative to the cops — the level of grievance and
      risk-taking required to join the riot is far lower.
    </P>
    <P>
      This is how, as Mao liked to say,
      <a href="https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-1/mswv1_6.htm"
      target=new>‘‘a single spark can cause a prairie fire’’</a> (星火
      燎原; 1930). Coincidentally, the Bolshevik newspaper founded by
      Lenin was called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iskra"
      target=new><I>Iskra</I></a>, or "spark."
    </P>
    <P>
      The Russian revolution itself provides a beautiful example of
      the chance spatial correlation of aggrieved agents. On February
      23, 1917, the day before the uprising, many residents of
      Petrograd were standing in food queues, because of rumors that
      food was in short supply.  Twenty thousand workers were in the
      streets after being locked out of a large industrial
      complex. Hundreds of off-duty soldiers were outdoors looking for
      distraction. And, as the day went on, multitudes of women
      workers left their factories early to march in celebration of
      Women’s Day. The combined crowd quickly turned into a
      self-reinforcing mob. It managed to topple the Romanov dynasty
      within 4 days.
    </P>
  
</DIV>




<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>a time series analysis</h1>

  <img src="Epstein02-fig3.png" class="figure-right" height=300>
    <P>
      A time series of the total number of rebels is also
      revealing. It displays one of the hallmarks of complex systems:
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punctuated_equilibrium_in_social_theory"
      target=new>punctuated equilibrium</a>. Long periods of relative
      stability are punctuated by outbursts of rebellious
      activity. And indeed, many major revolutions (e.g., East German)
      are episodic in fact.
    </P>
    <P>
      <img src="Epstein02-fig4.png" class="figure-right" height=300>
      The same qualitative pattern of behavior — punctuated
      equilibrium — rsists indefinitely, as shown in the plot of data
      from 20,000 iterations of the model.
      </P>
  
</DIV>



<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>waiting time distribution</h1>

  <img src="Epstein02-fig5.png" class="figure-right" height=350>
  <P>
    Is there any underlying regularity to these complex dynamics? For
    many complex systems, it turns out to be of considerable interest
    to study the distribution of waiting times between outbursts above
    some threshold. In this analysis, we set the threshold at 50
    actives. An outburst begins when the number of actives exceeds 50
    and ends when it falls below 50. The distribution of the time
    between the end of one outburst and the start of the next is shown
    here for 100,000 iterations of the model.
  </P>
  <P>
    In the complexity literature, one often encounters the notion of
    an ‘‘emergent phenomenon.’’ This waiting time distribution surely
    qualifies as one. It was entirely unexpected and would have been
    quite hard to predict from the underlying rules of agent
    behavior. These data are clearly not uniformly distributed; but
    all distributions used in defining the agent population — the
    distribution of hardship and risk aversion — are uniform.
  </P>
    
</DIV>

  


<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>a ripeness index</h1>

  <img src="Epstein02-fig8.png" class="figure-right" height=350>
    <P>
      We often speak of a society as being ‘‘ripe for revolution.’’
      Society can be bright red on the right screen (indicating a high
      level of grievance) while being entirely blue on the left
      (indicating that no one is expressing, or ‘‘venting,’’ their
      grievance). So, if this combination of high average grievance
      \(\bar{G}\) on the right and high frequency of blues \(\bar{B}\)
      on the left were the best indicator of high tension, a
      reasonable ‘‘ripeness’’ index would be simply their product:
      \(\bar{G} \bar{B}\).
    </P>
    <P>
      This, however, ignores the crucial question, why are agents
      blue? If they are inactive simply because they are risk averse
      and have no inclination to go active, then they are not truly
      frustrated in the inactive blue state. So, for fixed \(\bar{G}\)
      and \(\bar{B}\) a good tension index should increase as average
      risk aversion falls (more agents want to act out, but are
      nonetheless staying blue).  Hence, a better simple measure is:
      \(\bar{G}\bar{B}/\bar{R}\) , where \(\bar{R}\) is average risk
      aversion. In the figure here, this measure is plotted against a
      curve of actives designed to exhibit high volatility. It is
      clear that a buildup of tension precedes each outburst and might
      be the basis of a warning indicator.
    </P>
  
</DIV>




<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>legitimacy reduction</h1>

  <img src="Epstein02-fig9.png" class="figure-right" height=300>
    <P>
      First, the effect of legitimacy being reduced in small
      increments. It displays three curves. The downward sloping upper
      curve plots the steady incremental decline in legitimacy over
      time. The horizontal red curve just above the time axis shows
      the number of actives in each time period. Even though
      legitimacy declines to zero, there is no red spike, no
      explosion, because—as discussed earlier—each new active is being
      picked off in isolation, before he can catalyze a wider
      rebellion. And this is why the middle curve—representing the
      total jailed population—rises smoothly over time.
    </P>
      <img src="Epstein02-fig10.png" class="figure-right" height=300>
	<P>
	  Next, legitimacy is held at its initially high level (of
	  0.90) for 77 periods. Then, in one jump, it is reduced to
	  0.70, where it stays. The upper legitimacy curve is a step
	  function. Even though the absolute legitimacy reduction (of
	  0.30) is far smaller than before, there is an explosion of
	  actives, shown by the red spike. And, in turn, there is a
	  sharp rise in the jailed population, whose absolute size
	  exceeds that of the previous run.
	</P>
	
</DIV>




<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>legitimacy reduction (cont.)</h1>

  <P>
    Now, why the difference?  In the incremental legitimacy reduction
    scenario, the potentially catalytic agents at the tail of the
    grievance distribution are being picked off in isolation, before
    they can stimulate a local contagion. The sparks, as it were, are
    doused before the fire can take off. In the second— one-shot
    reduction—case, even though the absolute legitimacy decline is far
    smaller, multiple highly aggrieved agents go active at once. And
    by the same mechanism as discussed earlier, this depresses local
    \(C/A\) ratios enough that less aggrieved agents jump in. Hence,
    the rebellious episode is greater, even though the absolute
    legitimacy reduction is smaller.
  </P>
  <P>
    The rate of change—the derivative—of legitimacy emerges as
    salient.  This result would appear to have important implications
    for the tactics of revolutionary leadership. Rather than chip away
    at the regime’s legitimacy over a long period with daily expose´s
    of petty corruption, it is far more effective to be silent for
    long periods and accumulate one punchy expose´. Indeed, the single
    punch need not be as ‘‘weighty,’’ if you will, as the ‘‘sum’’ of
    the daily particulars.  (The one-shot legitimacy reduction need
    not be as great as the sum of all of the incremental deltas.)
  </P>
  <P>
    Perhaps this is why Mao would regularly seclude himself in the
    mountains in preparation for a dramatic reappearance, and why the
    return of exiled revolutionary leaders—like Lenin and Khomeini—are
    attended with such trepidation by authorities. Perhaps this is
    also why dramatic ‘‘triggering events’’ (e.g., assassinations)
    loom so large in the literature on this topic; often, they are
    instances in which the legitimacy of the regime suddenly takes a
    dive. By the same token, the earlier run (incremental legitimacy
    reductions) explains the counterrevolutionary value of agent
    provocateurs: they incite the most aggrieved agents to go active
    prematurely, allowing them to be arrested before they can catalyze
    the wider rebellion. While often sufficient, sharp legitimacy
    reductions are not the only inflammatory mechanism.
  </P>

  <h1>cop reductions</h1>

  <img src="Epstein02-fig11.png" class="figure-right" height=350>
    <P>
      According to de Tocqueville, "it oftener happens that when a
      people that has put up with an oppressive rule over a long
      period without protest suddenly finds the government relaxing
      its pressure, it takes up arms against it." In the cases of the
      French, Russian, and Iranian revolutions, substantial numbers of
      people were privately opposed to the regime. At the same time,
      the regime appeared strong, which ensured that public opposition
      was, in fact, unalarming. What, then, happened to break the
      appearance of the invincibility of the regime and to start a
      revolutionary bandwagon rolling? In the cases of France and
      Iran, the answer seems to lie, in large measure, in a lessening
      of government oppression. Indeed, de Tocqueville wrote that
      ‘‘liberalization is the most difficult of political arts.’’
    </P>
    <P>
      Here, liberalization is modeled as cop reductions. The figure
      shows the typical result.  Unlike the case of incremental
      legitimacy reductions above (salami tactics), there comes a
      point at which a marginal reduction in central authority does
      ‘‘tip’’ society into rebellion. The dynamics under reductions in
      repressive potential (cops) are fundamentally different from the
      dynamics under legitimacy reduction in this model—and perhaps in
      societies. Because both types of reduction are emboldening to
      revolutionaries, one might have imagined that reductions in the
      regime’s repressive power—the cop level—would produce dynamics
      equivalent to those under legitimacy reduction.  As we see,
      however, the dynamics are fundamentally different.

    <ul>
      <li>
	Unexpected emergence of individually deceptive behavior, in
	which privately aggrieved agents hide their feelings when cops
	are near, but engage in openly rebellious activity when the
	cops move away.
      </li>
      <li>
	Political ‘‘tipping points’’—revolutionary situations in which
	the screen is blue on the left (all agents quiescent) but red
	on the right.  Surface stability prevails despite deep and
	widespread hostility to the regime. When pushed beyond these
	tipping points, the model produces outbursts of violence and
	punctuated equilibria.
      </li>
      <li>
	The model explains standard repressive tactics like
	restrictions on freedom of assembly and the imposition of
	curfews.  Such policies function to prevent the random spatial
	clustering of highly aggrieved risk-takers, whose activation
	reduces the local cop-to-active ratio, permitting other less
	aggrieved and more timid agents to join in.
      </li>
      <li>
	Legitimacy can fall much farther incrementally than it can in
	one jump, without stimulating large-scale rebellion. However
	(quite unlike legitimacy reductions), incremental reductions
	in repressive potential (cops) can produce large-scale tipping
	events.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </P>
  <P>
    The model seems most promising for cases of decentralized
    upheaval. Although one could argue that certain effects of
    revolutionary leadership—reductions in perceived legitimacy
    through rousing speeches or writings that expose regime
    corruption—are captured, explicit leadership as such is really not
    modeled. That could be a weakness in cases—for example, the
    communist Chinese revolution—where central leadership was
    important, although some would argue that, even there, the main
    issue was not the individual leader, but society’s ‘‘ripeness for
    revolution.’’ As Engels wrote, ‘‘in default of Napoleon, another
    would have been found’’.

  <h1>Model II: inter-group violence</h1>

  <img src="Epstein02-fig12.png" class="figure-right" height=350>
    <P>
      Two "ethnic groups": blue and green. As in Model 1, agents turn
      red when active, which now means killing an agent of the other
      ethnic group.  Legitimacy is modeled as each group’s assessment
      of the other’s right to exist; \(L\) is exogenous and the same
      for each group.
    </P>
    <P>
      There is also some simple population dynamics: agents clone
      offspring onto unoccupied neighboring sites with probability
      \(p\) each period. Offspring inherit the parent’s ethnic
      identity and grievance. Because there is birth, there must be
      death to prevent saturation. Accordingly, agents are assigned a
      random death age from \(U(0, max_{age})\). Cops are as before,
      and arrest—evenhandedly—red agents within their vision. (This
      assumption of even-handedness can, of course, be relaxed.)
    </P>
    <P>
      In this run, legitimacy is set to a high number, just to check
      whether peaceful coexistence prevails with no cops. The left
      screen clearly shows spatial heterogeneity and peaceful mixing
      of groups with no red agents. On the right, only the palest of
      pink shades, indicating low levels of grievance, are seen.
      Harmonious diversity prevails.

  <h1>ethnic cleansing</h1>

  <img src="Epstein02-fig13.png" class="figure-right" height=600>
    <P>
      With no cops to regulate the competition, if \(L\) falls, even
      to \(0.8\), ethnic cleansing results.  The sequence of five
      panels in this figure clearly shows local episodes of ethnic
      cleansing, leading ultimately to the annihilation of one group
      by the other: genocide.
    </P>
    <P>
      Over a large number of runs \((n = 30)\), genocide is always
      observed. The victor is random. The phenomenon is strongly
      reminiscent of ‘‘competitive exclusion’’ in population
      biology. When two closely related species compete in a confined
      space for the same resource, one will gain an edge and wipe the
      other out. If, however, the inter-species competition is
      regulated by a predator that feeds evenhandedly on the
      competitors, then both can survive. Peacekeepers are analogous
      to such predators. 
    </P>

<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>peacekeeping and safe havens</h1>

  <img src="Epstein02-fig14.png" class="figure-right" height=350>
    <P>
      This run beging exactly as in the previous genocide case. But,
      at \(t=50\), a force of peacekeepers is deployed. They go to
      random unoccupied sites on the lattice. This typically produces
      safe havens.
    </P>
    <P>
      Rather than begin with no cops initially, as in the previous
      run, a case with high initial cop density was also
      examined. Once a stable pattern had emerged, the cops were
      withdrawn. Here, with heavy authority from the start (a high cop
      density of 0.04), a stable, but nasty, regime emerges. The
      presence of cops prevents either side from wiping the other out,
      but their coexistence is not peaceful: ethnic hostility is
      widespread at all times.  When (ceteris paribus) all cops are
      withdrawn—the peacekeepers suddenly go home—there is reversion
      to competitive exclusion and, eventually, one side wipes out the
      other.

  <h1>main insights from Model 2</h1>

    <ul>
      <li>
	With high legitimacy (mutual perception by each ethnic group
	of the other’s right to exist), peaceful coexistence between
	ethnic groups is observed; no peacekeepers are needed.
      </li>
      <li>
	However, if the force density is held at zero, and legitimacy
	is reduced (to 0.8), local episodes of ethnic cleansing are
	seen, leading to surrounded enclaves of victims, and
	ultimately to the annihilation of one group by the other.
      </li>
      <li>
	With early intervention on a sufficient scale, this process
	can be stopped. Safe havens emerge. With high cop density from
	the outset, the same level of legitimacy (0.8) produces a
	stable society plagued by endemic ethnic violence.
      </li>
      <li>
	If cops are suddenly removed, there is reversion to
	competitive exclusion and genocide.
