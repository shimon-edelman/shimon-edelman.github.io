  <h1><I>Pattern-Oriented Modeling of Agent-Based Complex Systems: Lessons from Ecology</I> [Grimm et al. 2005]</h1>

  <P>
  <BR>
    "What makes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Bond"
    target=new>James Bond</a> an agent?  He has a clear goal, he is
    autonomous in his decisions about achieving the goal, and he
    adapts these decisions to his rapidly changing situation. We are
    surrounded by such autonomous, adaptive agents: cells of the
    immune system, plants, citizens, stock market investors,
    businesses, etc.
  </P>
  <P>
    The agent-based complex systems (ACSs) around us are made up of
    myriad interacting agents. One of the most important challenges
    confronting modern science is to understand and predict such
    systems. Bottom-up simulation modeling is one tool for doing so:
    We compile relevant information about entities at a lower level of
    the system (in agent-based models, these are individual agents),
    formulate theories about their behavior, implement these theories
    in a computer simulation, and observe the emergence of
    system-level properties related to particular questions."

<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>Pattern-Oriented Modeling</h1>

  <P>
  <BR>
    The identification of general principles underlying the
    organization of ACSs has been hampered by the lack of an explicit
    strategy for coping with the two main challenges of bottom-up
    modeling: COMPLEXITY and UNCERTAINTY.  Consequently, model
    structure often is
    chosen <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hoc"
    target=new><I>ad hoc</I></a>, and the focus is often on how to
    represent agents without sufficient emphasis on analyzing and
    validating the applicability of models to real problems.
  </P>
  <P>
    A strategy called pattern-oriented modeling (POM) attempts to make
    bottom-up modeling more rigorous and comprehensive. In POM, we
    explicitly follow the basic research program of science: the
    explanation of observed
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"
    target=new>patterns</a>.<sup><font color=red>*</font></sup>
    Patterns are defining characteristics of a system and often,
    therefore, indicators of essential underlying processes and
    structures. Patterns contain information on the internal
    organization of a system, but in a "coded" form. The purpose of
    POM is to "decode" this information.

  <h1>choosing the right level for the model</h1>

  <img src="GrimmEtAl05-fig1.png" class="figure-right" height=450>
  <P>
    Payoff of bottom-up models versus their complexity.
  </P>
  <P>
    A model’s payoff is determined not only by how useful it is for
    the problem it was developed for, but also by its structural
    realism; i.e., its ability to produce independent predictions that
    match observations. If model design is guided only by the problem
    to be addressed (which often is the explanation of a single
    pattern), the model will be too simple. If model design is driven
    by all the data available, the model will be too
    complex.
  </P>
  <P>
    <I>
      [NO, this in itself is not the problem. The
      problem is that such a model
      will <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting"
	      target=new>overfit</a>.]
    </I>
  </P>
  <P>
    But there is a zone of intermediate
    complexity where the payoff is high. We call this the
    ‘‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Medawar"
    target=new>Medawar</a> zone’’.

  <P>
    Strong inference by contrasting alternative theories of the agents’
    behavior.
    <ol type=A>
      <li>
	Schools or flocks can emerge from simple rules for behavior, as
	in this version of boids.
      </li>
      <li>
	In a similar model of fish schools, 11 alternative theories of
	fish behavior were contrasted by looking at two school-level
	patterns: polarization (\(p\)) and nearest neighbor distance
	(\(NND\)); p is \(0^{\circ}\) if all fish swim in the same
	direction and p approaches \(90^{\circ}\) if all fish swim in
	random directions. Values of \(p\) observed in real fish
	schools are \(10^{\circ}\) to \(20^{\circ}\); observed \(NND\)
	is often \(<\) fish body length. In model versions 1 to 9, the
	influence of neighbor fish is averaged; in model version 10
	and 11 (shaded), fish select a single neighbor fish and orient
        their swimming to this neighbor only.

<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>pattern-oriented model design: summary</h1>

  <P>
  <BR>
  Multiple patterns keep us from building models that are too simple
  in structure and mechanism, or too complex and uncertain. Using
  patterns to test and contrast alternative theories for agent
  behavior or other low-level processes is a way for the science of
  ACS to get beyond clever demonstration models and on to rigorous
  explanations of how real systems are organized and how they respond
  to internal and external forces.
  <P>
    Bottom-up models are virtual laboratories where controlled
  experiments distinguish noise from signal in the system’s
  organization.  In particular, experiments contrasting hypotheses for
  the behavior of interacting agents will lead to an accumulation of
  theory for how the dynamics of systems from molecules to ecosystems
  and economies emerge from bottom-level processes.
  <P>
    This approach may change our whole notion of scientific theory,
  which until now has been based on the theories of physics. Theories
  of complex systems may never be reducible to simple analytical
  equations, but are more likely to be sets of conceptually simple
  mechanisms (e.g., Darwinian natural selection) that produce
  different dynamics and outcomes in different contexts. POM thus may
  lead us to an algorithmic, rather than analytical, approach to
  theory.
