  <h1>the factorization of happiness</h1>

  <P>
  A distinction is commonly drawn between two major components of
  happiness, operationalized as subjective well-being: the hedonic
  component, estimated through responses to questions such as “How
  happy are you right now?”, and the eudaimonic component, based on
  responses to questions such as “How happy are you with your life in
  general?”. To be useful in an ABM setting, each of these components
  must be given an explicit mathematical definition in terms of the
  independent variables of the model.
  <P>
  <img src="GaoEdelman16-1-fig1.png" height=300 class="figure-right">
    <B>An agent’s basic action loop.</B> <small>Motivation prompts
    actions, which lead to outcomes. Outcomes reap external hedonic
    rewards (food-related \(_{f}H\), and social \(_{s}H\)) and affect
    reproductive fitness. Hedonic states influence motivation, both
    directly, with the weight c, and through longer-term
    (“eudaimonic”) well-being \(E\), via the weight \(1 − c\). The
    parameters \(\Delta t\) and \(\lambda\) control, respectively, the
    time window over which \(E\) is estimated and the relative
    contributions of positive and negative changes of \(H\). After a
    set number of action cycles, each agent in the top half of the
    fitness distribution is allowed to produce offspring, which form
    the next generation; agents that belong to the current generation
    are terminated.</small>

<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>the individual agent: motivation, action, rewards, and well-being</h1>

  <P>
  <BR>
  The motivation \(M\) of agent \(k\) is a weighted sum of its hedonic
  and eudaimonic well-being, \(H\) and \(E\), with the parameter \(0
  \leq c \leq 1\) controlling their relative direct contributions;
  note that \(H\) also contributes to \(M\) indirectly, via its effect
  on \(E\):

  \begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
  M_k  = c \cdot H_k + (1-c) \cdot E_k
  \end{split}
  \end{equation}

  The effect of motivation is controlled by a threshold \(\theta\),
  which depends on the agent's past motivation:

  \begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
  \theta_k^{t}  = \frac{1}{\sum_{j=1}^{t-1} (\gamma ^j)}\sum_{i=1}^{t-1} \left(\gamma^{t-i} M_k \right)
  \end{split}
  \end{equation}

  where the threshold for agent \(k\) at time \(t\) is a weighted sum
  of past motivation values, \(\gamma \in [0,1]\) being the forgetting
  factor, which gives more weight to recent motivations.  When an
  agent's motivation exceeds the threshold \(\theta\), it chooses a
  more aggressive action, by venturing farther away from its present
  location, in a random direction. If the motivation is below the
  threshold, the exploration range is shorter.

  
</DIV>



<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>the individual agent (cont.)</h1>

  <P>
  After carrying out the chosen action, the agent updates \(H\), which
  consists of two components: \(_{f}H\), based on finding food during
  exploration, and \(_{s}H\), based on social comparison:

  \begin{equation}
  H_k=  (1-s_k) \cdot {_{f}H_k} + s_k \cdot {_{s}H_k}
  \end{equation}

  where \(s_k \in [0,1]\) is agent \(k\)'s sociality/food weighting
  parameter. The food-based component is:

  \begin{equation}
  _{f}H_k^{t} = {_{f}H_k^{t-1}} + \alpha_k F_k^{t} - \beta_f
  \end{equation}

  where \(F\) is the number of food units that the action yielded
  and \(\alpha_k\)controls the contribution of food to agent \(k\)'s
  hedonic well-being; \(\beta_f\) is the food equivalent of the
  agents' energy consumption per action cycle. For each agent, there
  is an upper bound on the maximum amount of food an agent can gain
  per cycle.

  The social component of hedonic well-being \(_{s}H\) for agent \(k\)
  at time \(t\) is:

  \begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    _{s}H_k^t = H_k^t  - \cfrac{1}{n_k} \sum_{j=1}^{n_k} \left(  H_j^t \right) + \beta_s
  \end{split}
  \end{equation}

  where the trait \(n_k\) represents the size of agent \(k\)'s social
  comparison group.  Intuitively, an agent is happier when it is doing
  better than group average and less happy otherwise; \(\beta_s\) is the
  base hedonic well-being gain from socialization.
  
</DIV>



<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>the individual agent (cont.)</h1>

  <P>
    The agent's eudaimonic well-being \(E\) is then computed from its
    present value of \(H\), the memory of the past values of \(H\)
    extending over a number of cycles, and the rates of rise and fall
    of \(H\):

    \begin{equation}
    E^t_k = \cfrac{1}{\Delta t_k} \sum_{i=t- \Delta t_k}^t \left( H_k^i +
    s_p\left(\cfrac{d H_k^i}{di}\right) + s_n\left(\cfrac{d H_k^i}{di}\right) \right) \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\\
    s_p (x) = \left\{ \begin{array}{lc}
      _p\lambda_k \cdot x & x\geq0 \\  
      0 & x < 0
    \end{array}\right. \;\;\;\;\;\;
    s_n (x) = \left\{ \begin{array}{lc}
      0 & x \geq 0 \\  
      _n\lambda_k \cdot x & x < 0
    \end{array}\right. \;\;
   \end{equation}

   where \(\Delta t_k\) is the extent of the memory window for
   agent \(k\). The step function \(s_p\) selects the weight assigned to
   upswings of \(H\) and and \(s_n\) — to downswings; \(_p\lambda_k\) and
   \(_n\lambda_k\) are the respective weights. Thus, every individual can in
   principle value positive and negative events differently.

  In parallel with computing \(H\) and \(E\) (which are subsequently fed
  back and used to determine motivation, the agent&rsquo;s fitness is
  updated: 

  \begin{equation}
  \mathcal{F}_k^t = \sum_{i=1}^t (F_k^i -A_k^i - \beta_0)
  \end{equation}

  Thus, the fitness \(\mathcal{F}\) of agent \(k\) at time \(t\) is
  the total amount of food \(F_k^t\) that it consumed, less the cost
  \(A_k^t\) of its actions (with aggressive and conservative actions
  weighted appropriately) and a base metabolic cost \(\beta_0\).

  At the end of each generation, agents within the top \(50\%\) of the
  fitness distribution reproduce, passing their traits to their
  offspring, whose number is proportional to the parent&rsquo;s
  fitness. All agents in the current generation are then terminated.

  <img src="GaoEdelman16-1-fig2.png" height=550 class="figure-right">
  <P>
    Four types of environment, which differed in the spatial
    distribution of food: random scarce (top left); random average
    (top right); patchy average (bottom left); and patchy abundant
    (bottom right). Each \(200\times 200\) environment was populated
    in every generation by \(400\) agents. At the end of every
    generation cycle, the environments were initialized anew with
    their corresponding food distributions.
<P>
  In each of the experiments described below, the parameter (trait) of
  interest was discretized as appropriate, so that equal proportions
  of the population carried each level of the trait; the other
  parameters were kept fixed. Each experiment was repeated 10 times;
  each of the Figures below shows the means and the 95% confidence
  intervals for the number of carriers in the population of each level
  of the trait of interest, plotted against generation number.

  <h1>lessons</h1>

  <P>
    <BR>
      The general lesson from these findings is that the optimal mix
      of happiness-related behavioral control parameters (traits whose
      carriers dominate the population) depends on the environment.
      <P>
	More specific lessons:
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    The effects of attaching more weight to longer-term than
	    to momentary happiness and of extending the memory for
	    past happiness are both stronger in an environment where
	    food is scarce.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Furthermore, in such an environment the “arms race” of
	    relative consumption, in which the agent’s well-being is
	    diminished if its neighbors are also well or better off,
	    is more detrimental to survival.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Finally, a positive outlook, under which longer-term
	    happiness gets more increase from positive events than
	    decrease from negative ones, is generally advantageous,
	    except in particularly harsh environments.
	  </li>
	</ul>
  
</DIV>



<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>lessons</h1>

  <P>
    <BR>
      This set of findings may be compared to the sentiment expressed
      in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laozi"
      target=new>Laozi</a>’s
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tao_Te_Ching"
	 target=new><I>Dao De Jing</I></a> under the heading of
	 curbing desire
	 (<a href="http://www.egreenway.com/taoism/ttclz46.htm"
	 target=new>chapter 46</a>): “The satisfaction of contentment
      is an everlasting competence” —

      <pre>
	
	天下有道. 
	卻走馬以糞. 
	天下無道.
	戎馬生於郊. 
	禍莫大於不知足.

	</pre>

      <P>
	It may indeed be advisable, at least under conditions of
	scarcity or adversity, to focus on longer-term well-being or
	eudaimonia (“contentment”) over momentary pleasures and to be
	less envious of one’s neighbors; also, in general, to mark
