  <P>
    "What is
    <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/morality-definition/"
    target=new>morality</a>? And to what extent does it vary around
    the world? The theory of “morality-as-cooperation” argues that
    morality consists of a collection of biological and cultural
    solutions to the problems of cooperation that arise in human
    social life. It draws on the theory of
    non-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum_game"
    target=new>zero-sum</a> games and predicts that specific forms of
    cooperative behavior —
  </P>
  <P>
    <ol>
      <li>
	helping kin
      </li>
      <li>
	helping your
	group
      </li>
      <li>
	reciprocating
      </li>
      <li>
	being brave
      </li>
      <li>
	deferring to superiors
      </li>
      <li>
	dividing disputed resources
      </li>
      <li>
	respecting prior possession
      </li>
    </ol>
  </P>
  <P>
    — will be considered morally good wherever they arise, in all
    cultures. To test these predictions, we investigate the moral
    valence of these seven cooperative behaviors in the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnography"
    target=new>ethnographic</a> records of 60 societies."

  <P>
    <B>Allocation of Resources to Kin (Family Values)</B>.
  </P>
  <P>
    Genes that benefit replicas of themselves in other individuals —
    that is, genetic relatives — will be favored by natural selection
    if the cost of helping is outweighed by the benefit to the
    recipient gene(s). So, under some conditions organisms will
    possess adaptations for detecting and delivering benefits (or
    avoiding doing harm) to kin.
  </P>
  <P>
    This theory of
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kin_selection"
    target=new>kin selection</a> explains many instances of altruism,
    in many species, including humans.  Morality-as-cooperation leads
    us to expect that this type of cooperative behavior — caring for
    offspring, helping family members, and avoiding inbreeding — will
    be regarded as morally good.

    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory"
    target=new>Game theory</a> models situations in which individuals
    are uncertain about how to behave to bring about a mutual benefit
    as coordination problems. Humans and other animals use a variety
    of strategies — such as
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focal_point_(game_theory)"
    target=new>focal points</a>, traditions, leadership, signaling,
    badges of membership, and
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_mind"
    target=new>“theory of mind”</a> — to solve these problems and form
    stable coalitions and alliances.
  </P>
  <P>
    Morality-as-cooperation leads us to expect that this type of
    cooperative behavior — forming friendships, participating in
    collaborative endeavors, favoring your own group, and adopting
    local conventions — will be regarded as morally good.

    <B>Social Exchange (Reciprocity)</B>.

    In game theory, social dilemmas —
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma"
    target=new>prisoners’ dilemmas</a>, public goods games,
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons"
    target=new>tragedies of the commons</a> — arise when the fruits of
    cooperation are vulnerable to exploitation by
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-rider_problem"
    target=new>“free riders”</a>, who accept the benefit of
    cooperation without paying the cost. This problem can be overcome
    by a strategy of “conditional cooperation” or “reciprocal
    altruism,” such as
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tit_for_tat"
       target=new>tit-for-tat</a>.

  <P>
    Morality-as-cooperation leads us to expect that this type of

  <h1>types of cooperation: 4, 5</h1>

  <P>
    <B>Contests between Hawks (Bravery) and Doves (Respect)</B>.
  </P>
  <P>
    Conflict over resources — food, territory, and mates — presents
    organisms with an opportunity to cooperate by competing in less
    mutually destructive ways. There are three ways of achieving this:
    <ul>
      <li>
	<I>contests</I> (featuring the display of
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawk"
	   target=new>hawkish</a> and
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbidae"
	   target=new>dovish</a> traits) [cooperation types 4,5];
      </li>
      <li>
	<I>division</I> [type 6];
      </li>
      <li>
	<I>respecting possession</I> [type 7].
      </li>
    </ul>
  </P>
  <P>
    Game theory has shown that conflicts can be settled through
    “contests,” in which individuals display
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handicap_principle"
    target=new>reliable indicators</a> of their “fighting ability,”
    and defer to the stronger party.
  </P>
  <P>
    Morality-as-cooperation leads us to expect that these types of
    cooperative behavior — hawkish displays of dominance (the “heroic
    virtues” of bravery, fortitude, skill, and wit) and dovish
    displays of submission (the “monkish virtues” of humility,
    deference, obedience, and respect) — will be regarded as morally
    good.
  </P>

</div>



<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>types of cooperation: 6</h1>

  <P>
    <B>Division (Fairness).</B>
  </P>
  <P>
    When the contested resource is divisible, game theory models the
    situation as a “bargaining problem”. Here, one solution is to
    divide the resource in proportion to the relative (bargaining)
    power of the protagonists. Rules such as “I cut, you choose,”
    “meet in the middle,” “split the difference,” and “take turns” are
    ancient and widespread means of resolving disputes.  And “equal
    shares” is a spontaneous and cross-culturally prevalent decision
    rule in economic games and similar situations.
  </P>
  <P>
    Morality-as-cooperation leads us to expect that this type of
    cooperative behavior — dividing disputed resources, reaching a
    compromise, being fair — will be regarded as morally good.
  </P>

</div>


<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>types of cooperation: 7</h1>
  
  <P>
    <B>Possession (Property Rights).</B>
  </P>
  <P>
    Finally, game theory shows that conflicts over resources can be
    resolved by recognition of prior possession.  Humans defer to
    prior possession in vignette studies, experimental games, the law,
    and international relations. Private property, in some form or
    other, appears to be a cross-cultural universal.
  </P>
  <P>
    Morality-as-cooperation leads us to expect that this type of
    cooperative behavior — deferring to prior possession — will be
    regarded as morally good.
  </P>
   
</DIV>    
    


<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>the present study: motivation</h1>

  <P>
    Although much evidence for the universality of cooperation had
    been gathered before, the previous studies were not designed to,
    and indeed do not, test fully morality-as-cooperation’s specific
    predictions.
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_anthropology"
    target=new>Comparative anthropology</a> has not systematically
    assessed the moral valence of all seven forms of cooperative
    behavior: moral values relating to hawkish and dovish traits in
    the adult population, and dividing disputed resources, are
    conspicuously absent from the literature.
  </P>
  <P>
    And no previous questionnaire research has evaluated all seven
    types of cooperative behavior posited by the theory: existing
    scales typically measure something other than moral valence (e.g.,
    they ask whether a person or a society possesses a particular
    trait, rather than whether the trait is moral); and the disparate
    samples are typically university students, or people in Western,
    educated, industrialized, rich, democratic
    (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology#WEIRD_bias"
    target=new>WEIRD</a>) societies, or people with access to the
    internet, which limits their
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_validity"
    target=new>external validity</a> and generalizability to
    “humanity” at large.
  </P>

</div>


<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>the present study: outline</h1>
  
  <P>
    And so, to test our predictions, to overcome the limitations of
    previous research, and to resolve lingering uncertainty over
    cross-cultural variation in moral values, we surveyed the moral
    valence of <I>the seven cooperative behaviors</I> in a single,
    homogenous, coherent source of high-quality ethnographic data,
    collected from a sample of 60 societies specifically chosen to
    provide as representative a sample of humanity as possible.
  </P>
  <P>
    In addition to reporting the moral valence of these cooperative
    behaviors, we also report their cross-societal frequency and
    distribution. After all, it is possible that even if
    morality-as-cooperation’s predictions regarding the moral valence
    of cooperative behaviors are supported, these behaviors and their
    corresponding moral values may still turn out to be rare, present
    in relatively few societies, or in only some regions but not
    others.
  </P>

<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>where the ethnographic data came from: locations of the 60 societies.</h1>

  <img src="Curry19-fig1.png" class="figure-right" height=400>
  <P>
    First, we extracted paragraph-level ethnographic materials indexed
    by professional anthropologists for the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Relations_Area_Files"
    target=new>eHRAF</a> as Ethics or Norms. The extraction extraction
    of materials indexed as Ethics resulted in 2,519 paragraphs from
    400 documents across the 60 societies sampled. The extraction of
    materials indexed as Norms resulted in 1,605 paragraphs from 263
    discrete documents across 58 of the societies sampled.
  </P>
  <P>
    Second, the entire archive was searched using a combination of
    relevant indexical headings (e.g., “Mutual Aid”) and keyword
    combinations. This phase identified 1,737 paragraphs from 355
    discrete documents across the 60 societies. When duplicate
    paragraphs were removed (i.e., 2,401 paragraphs identified in more
    than one phase), we were left with a total of 3,460 paragraphs,
    containing 606,556 words, from 603 unique sources, published over
    a period spanning 300 years.
  </P>
   
</DIV>    
    


<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>coding the ethnographic data</h1>

  <P>
    The coding procedure involved making 24,220 (3,460 \(\times\) 7)
    coding decisions — that is, deciding whether or not each of the
    3,460 paragraphs indicated that any of the seven cooperative
    behaviors had a positive or negative moral valence.  Raters 1 and
    2 (two of the authors) independently coded the full set of 3,460
    paragraphs and then conferred to resolve ambiguities and
    discrepancies. This resulted in a total of 1,426 paragraphs that
    contained material germane to one or more moral domain.
  </P>
  <P>
    A hypothesis-blind independent coder (rater 3) then coded each of
    these 1,426 paragraphs before discussing coding discrepancies with
    raters 1 and 2. Of the 1,426 \(\times\) 7 = 9,982 initial coding
    decisions compared between the two sets of codes, there were 8,704
    decisions in agreement and 1,278 decisions on which the raters
    disagreed—thus there was “moderate”
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohen%27s_kappa"
    target=new>agreement</a> between the two initial sets of ratings
    overall (\(\kappa = .58, P < .005\)).
  </P>
  <P>
    Raters 1, 2, and 3 then met to discuss and analyze discrepancies
    using the resolution method. On closer inspection it was
    discovered that the poor level of agreement with regard to
    “dividing disputed resources” was the result of rater 3 including
    cases of generic “sharing.” These and other rating discrepancies
    were reviewed and resolved until complete agreement was reached
    (\(\kappa = 1\)).  In the final analysis, of the 3,460 paragraphs
    reviewed, 761 contained information about the moral valence of one
    or more of the seven cooperative behaviors. This gave rise to 962
    observations of moral valence in total.

    <I>The instructions to coders:</I> “Please read through the
    following paragraphs. Your task is to decide, for each paragraph,
    whether it contains evidence that any of seven behaviors explained

    behavior is good, right,moral, ethical, or virtuous, or that it is

    indicated by morally-valenced words. For example, the mere mention
    of ‘family loyalty,’ or ‘property rights’ would suffice. Moral
    goodness can also be indicated by evidence that not performing the

  </P>
  <P>
    In 961 out of 962 observations (99.9%), cooperative behavior had a
    positive moral valence. The one exception to the rule — among the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuuk_State"
    target=new>Chuuk</a>, “to steal openly from others is admirable in
    that it shows a person’s dominance and demonstrates that he is not
    intimidated by the aggressive powers of others” — appears to be a
    case in which one form of cooperation (respect for property) has
    been trumped by another (respect for a hawkish trait, although not
    explicitly bravery).
  </P>
  <P>
    <small>
      There were 18 other examples of these seven moral values coming
      into conflict: nine examples of conflict between helping family
      and helping group; two of conflict between helping family and
      being brave; two of conflict between helping family and
      deferring to authority; and one example each of conflict between
      helping family and reciprocating, helping group and being brave,
      reciprocating and being brave, being brave and being
      deferential, and being deferential and respecting possession.
      However, in these cases, the moral values were portrayed as
      being in conflict, rather than one being good and the other bad.

  </P>
  <P>
    There were significantly more societies in which “property” was
    observed than “bravery,” “respect,” and “fairness”; and there were
    significantly fewer societies in which “fairness” was observed
    than all other types of moral behavior. All other differences were
    nonsignificant. There were no societies in which any of the seven
    cooperative behaviors had a negative moral valence. (The
    “exception” reported above was itself an exception—seven other
    paragraphs attested to the positive moral valence of property
    among the Chuuk).
  </P>
  <P>
    When aggregated by cultural region, all seven positively morally
    valenced cooperative behaviors were observed in all six regions —
    with the sole exception of “dividing disputed resources” in
    Central America (for which there were no data). Crucially, the
    positively morally valenced cooperative behaviors were observed
    with equal frequency in all regions.

</DIV>    
    


<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>conclusions</h1>

  <P>
    A survey of 60 diverse societies found that the moral valence of
    seven cooperative behaviors was uniformly positive. In every
    society for which there were data, these seven cooperative
    behaviors behaviors were considered morally good. There were no
    counterexamples, that is, societies in which these behaviors were
    considered morally bad. The survey also found that these
    cooperative morals were widespread — with most appearing in most
    societies — and that they were observed with equal frequency
    across all cultural regions.
  </P>
  <P>
    As such, these results provide strong support for the theory of
    morality-as-cooperation, and no support for the more extreme
    versions of
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_relativism"
    target=new>moral relativism</a>. In short,
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hume"
    target=new>Hume</a> was right, and
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Locke"
    target=new>Locke</a> was wrong. When you “look abroad into the
    several tribes of men” there are some widely held morals that are
    not elsewhere “slighted or condemned,” and they include precisely
    those morals predicted by morality-as-cooperation.  As
    <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/9662/9662-h/9662-h.htm"
    target=new>Hume (1748)</a> put it: “history informs us of nothing

  <P>
    Morality-as-Cooperation (MAC) is the theory that morality is a
    collection of biological and cultural solutions to the problems of
    cooperation recurrent in human social life. MAC uses game theory
    to identify distinct types of cooperation, and predicts that each
    will be considered morally relevant, and each will give rise to a
    distinct moral domain. Here we test MAC’s predictions by
    developing a new self-report measure of morality, the
    Morality-as-Cooperation Questionnaire (MAC-Q), and comparing its
    psychometric properties to those of the
    <a href="https://moralfoundations.org/questionnaires/"
    target=new>Moral Foundations Questionnaire</a> (MFQ). <B>Over four
    studies, the results support the MAC-Q’s seven-factor model of
    morality, but not the MFQ’s five-factor model.</B> Thus MAC emerges as
    the best available compass with which to explore the moral
    landscape.

  <h1>Moral Foundations theory (J. Haidt et al.)</h1>

  <P>
    <a href="https://moralfoundations.org/" target=new>Moral
      Foundations Theory</a> proposes that several innate and

      “intuitive ethics.” Each culture then constructs virtues,

      thereby creating unique moralities, which differ across the
      world and within nations. The five foundations for which we
      [Haidt et al.] think the evidence is best are:
  </P>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Care/harm: <small>related to our evolution as mammals with
      attachment systems and an ability to feel the pain of others;
      underlies virtues of kindness, gentleness, and
      nurturance.</small>
    </li>
    <li>
      Fairness/cheating: <small>related to the evolution of reciprocal
      altruism; generates ideas of justice, rights, and
      autonomy. [Note: In the original conception, Fairness included
      concerns about equality, which are more strongly endorsed by
      political liberals. A 2011 revision, based on new data,
      emphasized proportionality, which is endorsed by everyone, but
      more strongly by conservatives.]</small>
    </li>
    <li>
      Loyalty/betrayal: <small>related to our long history as tribal
      creatures able to form shifting coalitions; underlies virtues of
      patriotism and self-sacrifice for the group; is active anytime
      people feel that it’s “one for all, and all for one.”</small>
    </li>
    <li>
      Authority/subversion: <small>was shaped by the primate history
      of hierarchical social interactions; underlies virtues of
      leadership and followership, including deference to legitimate
      authority and respect for traditions.</small>
    </li>
    <li>
      Sanctity/degradation: <small>was shaped by the psychology of
      disgust and contamination; underlies religious notions of
      striving to live in an elevated, less carnal, more noble way and
      the widespread idea that the body is a temple which can be
      desecrated by immoral activities and contaminants.</small>

  <h1>testing Moral Foundations Theory (MFT) questionnaire</h1>

  <P>
    The results of this study support MFT’s claim that the contents of
    the five foundations are considered morally relevant. As such, the
    results support MAC’s prediction that cooperative behaviour
    relating to groups, deference and fairness (as well as the general
    category of ‘care’) will be regarded as morally relevant; but they
    appear to contradict MAC’s prediction that ‘purity’ will not be
    considered morally relevant.
  </P>
  <P>
    However, <B>the results do not support MFT’s proposed five-factor
    structure of morality</B>. Consistent with previous research, the
    overall internal reliability of the scale was low. Exploratory
    factor analysis did not yield the predicted five factors, on
    either Relevance or Judgement scales. (Nor did it reliably reveal
    the two ‘individualising’ and ‘binding’ factors.) Confirmatory
    analysis demonstrated that none of the five-factor models achieved
    a good fit on all criteria, either separately or when combined.
    Specifically, the MFQ was not able to distinguish between moral
    attitudes relating to groups and deference; Ingroup and Authority
    items loaded on the same factor.  Nor was the MFQ able to
    distinguish attitudes to fairness; Fairness items loaded on the
    same factor as Care. Neither Care nor Purity emerged as distinct
    factors on the Relevance scale, only Purity was a distinct factor
    on the Judgement scale.
  </P>
  <P>
    Thus MFT’s predictions were not supported. The MFQ was not able to
    identify the domains uniquely predicted by MFT (Care and Purity),

    and fairness) predicted by both MFT and MAC.

  <ol>
    <li>
      First, as MAC predicts, cooperative behaviour is considered

      give rise to seven distinct moral domains.
    </li>
    <li>
      Second, as MAC also predicts, behaviours not tied to a specific
      form of cooperation (‘care’ and ‘purity’) do not reliably emerge

    <li>
      Third, the MAC-Q distinguishes distinct domains relating to
      groups, deference and fairness, whereas the MFQ does not.

      egalitarian behavior as an instance of domination of leaders by

      of hierarchical behavior in general and of bossiness in leaders
      in particular. A substantial cross-cultural survey reveals the

  <h1>Boehm (1993): intentional leveling</h1>

  <P>
    [Boehm 1982] emphasized the causal role of intentions, suggesting
    that egalitarian political styles developed only after the
    emergence of the human capacity for purposeful, moralistic
    sanctioning. [The] general evolutionary interpretation was based
    on extant egalitarian societies and was not limited to foragers,
    and in a sense it reinterpreted "egalitarian society."  In short,
    it suggested that an apparent absence of hierarchy was the result
    of followers dominating their leaders rather than vice versa.
  </P>
  <P>
    Here a similar line of argument is pursued, with new evidence from
    an informal but rather extensive world survey of societies that
    exhibit the effects of <B>"reverse dominance hierarchy"</B>.

</div>  


<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>Boehm (1993): the survey</h1>

  <P>
    <B>The hypothesis: the primary cause of egalitarian behavior is a
    moralistic determination on the part of a local group&rsquo;s main
    political actors that no one of its members should be allowed to
    dominate the others.</B>
  </P>
  <P>
    Data assessment limited to actual group decisions with their

    Rather than restricting the survey to bands and "acephalous"
    tribes, consider all locally autonomous small-scale communities
    with low stratification by class and an absence of authoritative
    leadership.
  </P>
  <P>
    The object was to see whether intentional behavior (notably,
    social sanctioning) that had a leveling effect was widespread in
    such societies and, more specifically, whether it had any
    significant effects in suppressing the growth of authoritative
    leadership; seek to detect presence or absence of "egalitarian
    behavior," that is, any intentional behavior that decisively
    suppressed hierarchical relations among adults as political
    actors.
  </P>

    A basic criterion was that the societies be politically
    autonomous, since peasants and subject peoples are not really free
    to define their own political lives.  Also interested in seeing
    whether there might be any small-scale, weakly stratified
    societies that nevertheless exhibited very strong leadership and,

  <h1>Boehm (1993): the survey (cont.) — the qualitative methodology</h1>

  <P>
    Because of the paucity of detailed reports on interactions between
    leaders and followers, [Boehm] decided to forego statistical
    sampling and look for any piece of evidence or substantial clue
    that might help to support or falsify my hypothesis. Out of
    approximately 200 politically autonomous societies that were
    surveyed, about half simply provided no details as to specific
    dominance interactions of leaders and followers or about the tenor
    of dominance behavior within the group, while perhaps half that
    number provided mere hints (e.g., "leaders always were unassuming"
    or "leaders seem to avoid giving commands").

  <P>
    <B>Four dozen [reports]</B> contained solid and reliable evidence with
    respect to the specific politically insightful intentional
    behaviors that shaped the social and political roles of leading

    four was fully eligible.
  </P>
  <P>
    The "reading" of indigenous intentions is one of ethnology&rsquo;s
    most difficult tasks. [...] Because [Boehm] felt the research
    question to be an important one, [he] took into account any
    trustworthy and relevant description in which local autonomy was
    basically intact and in which contact effects on political
    behavior were limited and could be reasonably well accounted for.

<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>Boehm (1993): classes of intentional sanctioning</h1>

  <ul class="outline">
    <li>PUBLIC OPINION
      <ul>
	<li>
	  Public opinion can act as a check on leadership, as in
	  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tikopia"
	  target=new>Tikopia</a>, and at some point always limits
	  autocratic behavior in any society.
	</li>
	<li>
	  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navajo"
	  target=new>Navajo</a> chiefs meeting in council must stay in
	  tune with the people; the same is true
	  for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khoekhoe"
	  target=new>Hottentots</a>.
	</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>CRITICISM AND RIDICULE
      <ul>
	<li>
	  Ridicule, a special form of criticism, is calculated to
	  place strong pressure on the recipient; it threatens a
	  leader&rsquo;s status because he cannot lead without
	  respect.  Among the
	  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadza_people"
	  target=new>Hadza</a>, when a would-be "chief" tried to
	  persuade other Hadza to work for him, people openly made it
	  clear that his efforts amused them
	</li>
	<li>
	  Among <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mbuti_people"
	  target=new>Mbuti</a> Pygmies the better hunters who assume
	  leadership functions keep a low profile in group meetings or
	  else they are ridiculed.
	</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>DISOBEDIENCE
      <ul>
	<li>
	  Another way to teach a prominent man a lesson about the
	  boundaries of leadership and authority is simply to disobey
	  him if he tries to
	  command. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Clastres"
	  target=new>Pierre Clastres</a> reports that the notion of
	  (male) obedience to another adult is generally foreign to
	  South American Indians.
	</li>	
	<li>
	  Among the
	  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iban_people"
	  target=new>Iban</a>, if a chief tries to command, no one
	  listens.
	</li>
	<li>
	  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuer_people"
	  target=new>Nuer</a> either disobey direct orders or obey
	  them insultingly.
	</li>	
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>EXTREME SANCTIONS
      <ul>
	<li>
	  The ultimate egalitarian political rebuke is to terminate a
	  person&rsquo;s leadership role. The final solution is
	  assassination.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Individual lethal retaliation is a powerful leveling
	  mechanism among
	  the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadza_people"
	  target=new>Hadza</a> and one that carries little risk since
	  it can be accomplished by stealth.
	</li>
	<li>
	  A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C7%83Kung_people"
	  target=new>!Kung</a> community may execute "extremely
	  aggressive men".
	</li>
	<li>
	  Of course, in classical feuding societies killing an
	  extremely aggressive person becomes problematic with clan
	  retaliation, but a man&rsquo;s own clan can put him to death
	  with no further killing. [...] In New Guinea the execution
	  of a prominent individual who has overstepped his
	  prerogatives is secretly arranged by the other members of
	  the multi clan community, who persuade the target&rsquo;s
	  own kinsmen to accomplish the task.
	</li>
	<li>
	  A less direct technique is desertion. [...] The
	  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mescalero"
	  target=new>Mescalero</a> would join other bands if their
	  chief was dishonest, unreliable, or a liar.

    "The data do leave us with some ambiguities, but I believe that as

    so very successfully."
  </P>
  <P>
    <B>One major conclusion</B>, then, is that intentional leveling
    linked to an egalitarian ethos is an immediate and probably an
    extremely widespread cause of human societies&rsquo; failing to
    develop authoritative or coercive leadership.  This is a
    psychological interpretation. A "material" factor that seems to
    correlate universally with absence of such leadership is smallness
    of social scale. [...] This is a hypothesis worthy of testing.
  </P>
  <P>
    Prudent leaders set aside their own tendencies to dominate and
    submit to their groups even as they lead them. [...]  The social
    result of this interaction is a consensus-oriented community, a
    group that cooperates well and that remains small because in the
    absence of strong leadership it so readily subdivides. The
    resulting unity of purpose makes it possible for all or most
    members of local communities to unite against leaders and, by
    threat of disapproval or active sanctioning, circumscribe their
    role.  These would seem to be the personal and social dynamics
    that keep a typical egalitarian society in place. One aspect of
    these dynamics is an egalitarian ethos, both a cause and an effect
    of the ambivalences just discussed.
