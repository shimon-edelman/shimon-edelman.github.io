  <h1>altruistic punishment [Boyd et al. 2003]</h1>

  <P>
    Unlike any other species, humans cooperate with non-kin in large
    groups. This behavior is puzzling from an evolutionary perspective
    because cooperating individuals incur individual costs to confer
    benefits on unrelated group members.
  </P>
  <P>
    Altruistic punishment provides one solution to this puzzle. In
    laboratory experiments, people punish noncooperators at a cost to
    themselves even in one-shot interactions and ethnographic data
    suggest that such altruistic punishment helps to sustain
    cooperation in human societies.
  </P>
  <P>
    But: why do people incur costs to punish others and provide
    benefits to nonrelatives? Here we show that group selection can
    lead to the evolution of altruistic punishment in larger groups
    because the problem of deterring
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-rider_problem"
    target=new>free riders</a> in the case of <B>altruistic
    cooperation</B> is fundamentally different from the problem of
    deterring free riders in the case of <B>altruistic punishment</B>.
  </P>
  <P>
    The difference arises because the payoff disadvantage of
    altruistic cooperators relative to defectors is independent of the
    frequency of defectors in the population; in comparison, the cost
    disadvantage for those engaged in altruistic punishment declines
    as defectors become rare because acts of punishment become very
    infrequent. Thus, when altruistic punishers are common,
    individual-level selection operating against them is weak.
  </P>
  <P>
    In other words, in larger groups, altruistic cooperation may be
    still too costly, whereas <B>altruistic punishment is less and
    less costly, the more it succeeds</B>.
  </P>
  
</DIV>



<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>the key ideas</h1>

  <P>
    Consider a model in which a large population is divided into
    groups of size \(n\). There are two behavioral types, contributors
    and defectors. <B>Contributors</B> incur a cost \(c\) to produce a
    total benefit \(b\) that is shared equally among group members.
    <B>Defectors</B> incur no costs and produce no benefits. If the
    fraction of contributors in the group is \(x\), the expected
    payoff for contributors is \(bx - c\) and the expected payoff for
    defectors is \(bx\), so the payoff disadvantage of the
    contributors is a constant \(c\) independent of the distribution
    of types in the population.
  </P>
  <P>
    Now add a third type, ‘‘<B>punishers</B>’’ who cooperate and then
    punish each defector in their group, reducing each defector’s
    payoff by \(p/n\) at a cost \(k/n\) to the punisher. If the
    frequency of punishers is \(y\), the expected payoffs become \(b(x
    + y) - c\) to contributors, \(b(x + y) - py\) to defectors, and
    \(b(x + y) - c - k(1 - x - y)\) to punishers. Contributors have
    higher fitness than defectors if punishers are sufficiently common
    that the cost of being punished exceeds the cost of cooperating
    \((py > c)\).  Punishers suffer a fitness disadvantage of \(k(1 -
    x - y)\) compared with nonpunishing contributors. Thus, punishment
    is altruistic and mere contributors are ‘‘second-order
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-rider_problem"
    target=new>free riders</a>.’’ Note, however, that the payoff
    disadvantage of punishers relative to contributors approaches zero
    as defectors become rare because there is no need for punishment.
  </P>
  <P>
    The fact that punishers experience only a small disadvantage when
    defectors are rare means that weak within-group evolutionary
    forces, such as mutation or a conformist tendency, can stabilize
    punishment and allow cooperation to persist. But neither produces
    a systematic tendency to evolve toward a cooperative outcome. Here
    we explore the possibility that <I>selection among groups</I>
    leads to the evolution of altruistic punishment when it could not
    maintain altruistic cooperation.
  </P>
  
</DIV>



<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>the model</h1>

  <P>
    Suppose that more cooperative groups are less prone to
    extinction. [Humans always live in social groups in which
    cooperative activities play a crucial role.] Because groups with
    more punishers will tend to exhibit a greater frequency of
    cooperative behaviors (by both contributors and punishers), the
    frequency of punishers and cooperative behaviors will be
    positively correlated across groups. As a result, punishment will
    increase as a ‘‘correlated response’’ to group selection that
    favors more cooperative groups. Because selection within groups
    against punishment is weak when punishment is common, this process
    might support the evolution of substantial levels of punishment
    and maintain punishment once it is common.
  </P>
  <P>
    There are \(N\) groups. Local density-dependent competition
    maintains each group at a constant population size
    \(n\). Individuals interact in a two-stage ‘‘game.’’ During the
    first stage, contributors and punishers cooperate with probability
    \(1 - e\) and defect with probability \(e\).  Cooperation reduces
    the payoff of cooperators by an amount \(c\), and increases the
    ability of the group to compete with other groups.
  </P>
  <P>
    For simplicity, we begin by assuming that cooperation has no
    effect on the individual payoffs of others, but does reduce the
    probability of group extinction. Defectors always defect.  During
    the second stage, punishers punish each individual who defected
    during the first stage. After the second stage, individuals
    encounter another individual from their own group with probability
    \(1 - m\) and an individual from another randomly chosen group
    with probability \(m\). An individual \(i\) who encounters an
    individual \(j\) imitates \(j\) with probability \(W_j/(W_j +
    W_i)\), where \(W_x\) is the payoff of individual \(x\) in the
    game, including the costs of any punishment received or
    delivered.
  </P>

</DIV>



<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>the model (cont.)</h1>
  
  <P>
    Thus, imitation has two distinct effects: first, it creates a
    selection-like process that causes higher payoff behaviors to
    spread within groups. Second, it creates a migration-like process
    that causes behaviors to diffuse from one group to another at a
    rate proportional to \(m\).
  </P>
  <P>
    Because cooperation has no individual level benefits, defector
    behavior spreads between groups more rapidly than do contributor
    or punisher behaviors.  Group selection occurs through intergroup
    conflict. In each time period, groups are paired at random, and
    with probability \(\epsilon\), intergroup conflict results in one
    group defeating and replacing the other group. The probability
    that group \(i\) defeats group \(j\) is \(\frac{1}{2}(1 + (d_j -
    d_i))\), where \(d_q\) is the frequency of defectors in group
    \(q\). This means that the group with more defectors is more
    likely to lose a conflict. Note that cooperation is the sole
    target of the resulting group selection process; punishment
    increases only to the extent that the frequency of punishers is
    correlated with that of cooperation across groups.
  </P>
  <P>
    Finally, with probability \(\mu\) individuals of each type
    spontaneously switch into one of the two other types. The presence
    of mutation and erroneous defection ensure that punishers will
    incur some punishment costs, even when they are common, thus
    placing them at a disadvantage with respect to the contributors.
  </P>
  
</DIV>



<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>the model: methods</h1>

  <P>
    In all simulations there were 128 groups. Initially one group
    consisted of all altruistic punishers and the other 127 groups
    were all defectors. Simulations were run for \(2,000\) time
    periods. The long run average results plotted in the following
    figures represent the average of frequencies over the last
    \(1,000\) time periods of \(10\) simulations.
  </P>
  <P>
    Base case parameters were chosen to represent cultural evolution
    in small-scale societies. We set the time period to be 1
    year. Because individually beneficial cultural traits, such as
    technical innovations, diffuse through populations in \(10-100\)
    years, we set the cost of cooperation, \(c\), and punishing,
    \(k\), so that traits with this cost advantage would spread in
    \(50\) time periods \((c = k = 0.2)\).
  </P>
  <P>
    To capture the intuition that in human societies punishment is
    more costly to the punishee than to the punisher we set the cost
    of being punished to four times the cost of punishing \((p =
    0.8)\). We assume that erroneous defection is relatively rare \((e
    = 0.02)\). The migration rate, \(m\), was set so that in the
    absence of any other evolutionary forces, passive diffusion will
    cause two neighboring groups that are initially as different as
    possible to achieve the same trait frequencies in \(\approx 50\)
    time periods \((m = 0.01)\), a value that approximates the
    migration rates in a number of small-scale societies.
  </P>
  <P>
    We set the value of the mutation rate so that the long run average
    frequency of an ordinary adaptive trait with payoff advantage
    \(c\) is \(\approx 0.9\) \((\mu = 0.01)\). This means that
    mutation maintains considerable variation, but not so much as to
    overwhelm adaptive forces. We assume that the average group
    extinction rate is consistent with a recent estimate of cultural
    extinction rates in small-scale societies, \(\approx
    0.0075\). Because only one of the two groups entering into a
    conflict becomes extinct this implies that \(\mu = 0.015\).

  <h1>summary and conclusions [Boyd et al. 2003]</h1>

  <P>
    We have shown that although the logic underlying altruistic
    cooperation and altruistic punishment is similar, their
    evolutionary dynamics are not. In the absence of punishment,
    within-group adaptation acts to decrease the frequency of
    altruistic cooperation, and as a consequence weak drift-like
    forces are insufficient to maintain substantial variation between
    groups. In groups in which altruistic punishers are common,
    defectors are excluded, and this maintains variation in the amount
    of cooperation between groups.  Moreover, in such groups punishers
    bear few costs, and punishers decrease only very slowly in
    competition with contributors. <B>As a result, group selection is
    more effective at maintaining altruistic punishment than
    altruistic cooperation.</B>
  </P>
  <P>
    These results suggest that group selection can play an important
    role in the cultural evolution of cooperative behavior and
    moralistic punishment in humans. The importance of group selection
    is always a quantitative issue. There is no doubt that selection
    among groups acts to favor individually costly, group beneficial
    behaviors. The question is always, is group selection important
    under plausible conditions?
  </P>
  <P>
    With parameter values chosen to represent cultural evolution in
    small-scale societies, cooperation is sustained in groups on the
    order of 100 individuals.  If the ‘‘individuals’’ in the model
    represent family groups (on grounds that they migrate together and
    adopt common practices), altruistic punishment could be sustained
    in groups of 600 people, a size much larger than typical foraging
    bands and about the size of many ethno-linguistic units in
    nonagricultural societies.
  </P>

<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>altruistic punishment [Boyd et al. 2010]</h1>

  <P>
    Because mutually beneficial cooperation may unravel unless most
    members of a group contribute, people often gang up on
    free-riders, punishing them when this is cost-effective in
    sustaining cooperation. In contrast, current models of the
    evolution of cooperation assume that punishment is uncoordinated
    and unconditional.
  </P>
  <P>
    These models have difficulty explaining the evolutionary emergence
    of punishment because rare unconditional punishers bear
    substantial costs and hence are eliminated. Moreover, in human
    behavioral experiments in which punishment is uncoordinated, the
    sum of costs to punishers and their targets often exceeds the
    benefits of the increased cooperation that results from the
    punishment of free-riders. As a result, cooperation sustained by
    punishment may actually reduce the average payoffs of group
    members in comparison with groups in which punishment of
    free-riders is not an option.
  </P>
  <P>
    Here, we present a model of coordinated punishment that is
    calibrated for ancestral human conditions and captures a further
    aspect of reality missing from both models and experiments: <B>The
    total cost of punishing a free-rider declines as the number of
    punishers increases. We show that punishment can proliferate when
    rare, and when it does, it enhances group-average payoffs.</B>
  </P>
  
</DIV>



<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>the new model</h1>

  <P>
    We analyzed a model of the evolution of punishment that
    incorporates two empirically based features absent from previous
    work:
    <ol>
      <li>
	Punishment is coordinated among group members so that it is
	contingent on the number of others predisposed to participate
	in the punishment.  When individuals willing to punish are
	rare, they demur and so bear only the cost of signaling their
	willingness to punish.  They thus avoid the cost of punishing
	when it does not pay.
      </li>
      <li>
	Consistent with the “strength in numbers” and “divide and
	rule” maxims punishment is characterized by increasing returns
	to scale, so the total cost of punishing a single free-rider
	declines as the number of punishers increases.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </P>
  <P>
    Adding these two features resolves the problems with previous
    models. Our model shows that for levels of relatedness consistent
    with recent genetic data from hunter-gather populations,
    punishment can proliferate when rare, and when it is common it
    increases group-average fitness.

        above and below the solid and open circles. In these cases,

	and a mixed strategy at which punishers and nonpunishers
	coexist. In these cases, the unstable equilibria (open
	circles) mark the frequency that punishers must achieve before
				  they are favored by selection.

  <h1>summary</h1>

  <P>
    Unlike many models of the evolution of punishment, this one does
    not suffer from a “second-order
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-rider_problem"
    target=new>free-rider</a>” problem in which individuals who
    cooperate but do not punish out-compete the punishers.
  </P>
  <P>
    To see why, consider a new strategy: “contingent cooperators,” who
    cooperate during the first period if there are \(\tau + 1\)
    signaling individuals but do not punish. Contingent cooperators
    avoid punishment during the first period and otherwise behave like
    nonpunishers, and thus have higher fitness than nonpunishers. As a
    result, they invade the polymorphic punisher-nonpunisher
    equilibrium, replacing the nonpunishers.  However, because they
    still respond to punishment, and punishment still benefits
    punishers, the population evolves to a stable equilibrium at which
    punishers and contingent cooperators coexist and that cannot be
    invaded by other second-order free-riding types. The frequency of
    punishers at this new equilibrium is approximately the same as in
    the original punisher-nonpunisher equilibrium.
