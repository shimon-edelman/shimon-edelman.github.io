      "If a concept is not well defined, it can be abused. This is
      particularly true of
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity"
      target=new>complexity</a>, an inherently interdisciplinary
      concept that has penetrated a range of intellectual fields from
      physics to linguistics, but with no underlying, unified theory.
      Complexity has become a popular buzzword that is used in the
      hope of gaining attention or funding — institutes and research
      networks associated with complex systems grow like mushrooms."

<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>complexity</h1>

  <P>
    "The world is indeed made of many highly interconnected parts on
    many scales, the interactions of which result in a complex
    behaviour that requires separate interpretations of each
    level. This realization forces us to appreciate the fact that new
    features emerge as one moves from one scale to another, so it
    follows that the science of complexity is about revealing the
    principles that govern the ways in which these new properties
    appear."
  </P>
  <P>
    "In the past, mankind has learned to understand reality through
    simplification and analysis. Some important simple systems are
    successful idealizations or primitive models of particular real
    situations — for example, a perfect sphere rolling down an
    absolutely smooth slope in a vacuum. This is the world of
    newtonian mechanics, and it ignores a huge number of other,
    simultaneously acting factors. Although it might sometimes not
    matter that details such as the motions of the billions of atoms
    dancing inside the sphere’s material are ignored, in other cases
    reductionism may lead to incorrect conclusions."
  </P>
  <P>
    "In complex systems, we accept that processes that occur
    simultaneously on different scales or levels are important, and
    the intricate behaviour of the whole system depends on its units
    in a nontrivial way. Here, the description of the entire system’s
    behaviour requires a qualitatively new theory, because the laws
    that describe its behaviour are qualitatively different from those
    that govern its individual units."
  </P>

<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>two examples of complexity: fluid dynamics and neural dynamics</h1>

  <P>
    Two examples: "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbulence"
    target=new>turbulent flows</a> and the brain. Clearly, these are
    very different systems, but they share a few remarkable features,
    including the impossibility of predicting the rich behaviour of
    the whole by merely extrapolating from the behaviour of its units.
    Who can tell, from studying a tiny drop or a single neuron, what
    laws describe the intricate flow patterns in turbulence or the
    patterns of electrical activity produced by the brain?"
  </P>
  <P>
    "Moreover, in both of these systems (and in many others),
    randomness and determinism are both relevant to the system’s
    overall behaviour. Such systems exist on the edge of
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory"
    target=new>chaos</a> — they may exhibit almost regular behaviour,
    but also can change dramatically and stochastically in time and/or
    space as a result of small changes in conditions. This seems to be
    a general property of systems that are capable of producing
    interesting (complex) behaviour."

    "Knowledge of the physics of elementary particles is therefore
    useless for interpreting behaviour on larger scales. Each new
    level or scale is characterized by new, emergent laws that govern
    it. [To understand life, one must consider multiple levels of
    organization:] molecules, macromolecules, cells, organisms,
    species and societies."
  </P>
  <P>
    "The BIG QUESTION is whether there is a unified theory for the
    ways in which elements of a system organize themselves to produce
    a behaviour that is typical of large classes of systems."
  </P>
  
</DIV>

    
<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>complexity</h1>

  <P>
    "Interesting principles have been proposed in an attempt to
    provide such a unified theory.  These include
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-organization"
    target=new>self-organization</a>, simultaneous existence of many
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degrees_of_freedom"
    target=new>degrees of freedom</a>, self-adaptation, rugged
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_landscape"
    target=new>energy landscapes</a>, and scaling (for
    example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_law"
    target=new>power-law dependence</a>) of the parameters and the
    underlying network of connections. Physicists are learning how to
    build relatively simple models that can produce complicated
    behaviour, whereas those who work on inherently very complex
    systems (such as biologists and economists) are uncovering ways to
    interpret their subjects in terms of interacting, well-defined
    units (such as proteins [or people])."
  </P>
  <P>
    "What we are witnessing in this context is a change of
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm"
    target=new>paradigm</a> in attempts to understand our world as we
    realize that the laws of the whole cannot be deduced by digging
    deeper into the details. In a way, this change has been caused by
    the development of instruments. Traditionally, improved
    microscopes or bigger telescopes are built to gain a better
    understanding of particular problems. But computers have allowed
    new ways of learning. By directly modelling a system made of many
    units, one can observe, manipulate and understand the behaviour of
    the whole system much better than before, as in the cases of
    networks of model neurons and virtual auctions by intelligent
    agents, for example. In this sense, a computer is a tool that
    improves not our sight (as does the microscope or telescope), but
    rather our insight into mechanisms within complex systems."

  <h1>complex adaptive systems</h1>

  <P>
    Some of the most important characteristics of complex systems are
    [from the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_adaptive_system"
    target=new>Wikipedia page</a>]: 
    <ul>
      <li>
	The number of elements is sufficiently large that conventional
	descriptions (e.g. a system of differential equations) are not
	only impractical. Moreover, the elements interact dynamically,
	and the interactions can be physical or involve the exchange
	of information.
      </li>
      <li>
	Such interactions are rich, i.e. any element or sub-system in
	the system is affected by and affects several other elements
	or sub-systems.
      </li>
      <li>
	The interactions are non-linear: small changes in inputs,
	physical interactions or stimuli can cause large effects or
	very significant changes in outputs.
      </li>
      <li>
	Interactions are primarily but not exclusively with immediate
	neighbours and the nature of the influence is modulated.
      </li>
      <li>
	Any interaction can feed back onto itself directly or after a
	number of intervening stages. Such feedback can vary in
	quality. This is known as recurrency.
      </li>
      <li>
	The overall behavior of the system of elements is not
	predicted by the behavior of the individual elements.
      </li>
      <li>
	Such systems may be open and it may be difficult or impossible
	to define system boundaries.
      </li>
      <li>
	Complex systems operate under far from equilibrium
	conditions. There has to be a constant flow of energy to maintain
	the organization of the system.
      </li>
      <li>
	Complex systems have a history. They evolve and their past is
	co-responsible for their present behaviour.
      </li>
      <li>
	Elements in the system may be ignorant of the behaviour of the
	system as a whole, responding only to the information or
	physical stimuli available to them locally.
      </li>
    </ul>

	<B>Space (physical)</B>, location in geographical space & time
	of agents and artifacts.
      </li>
      <li>
	<B>Space (conceptual)</B>, "location" in a set of categories
	structured so that "nearby" agents will tend to interact.
      </li>
      <li>
	<B>Selection</B>, processes that lead to an increase or
	decrease in the frequency of various types of agent or
	strategies.
      </li>
      <li>
	<B>Success criteria</B> or performance measures, a "score"

    Complexity in the  context of creativity and innovation:

	<B>Path dependence</B>: Systems tend to be sensitive to their

    that are consistent with observations and that makes correct
