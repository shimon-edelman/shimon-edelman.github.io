      <ul>
	<li>

	    descriptive MATHEMATICAL models.
	  </li>
	<P>
	  <li>
	    Recent ABMs provide compelling accounts of group pattern

	  </li>
	<P>
	  <li>
	    ABMs overcome an assumption that underlies much of
	    cognitive science – that the individual is the crucial
	    unit of cognition. The alternative advocated here is that
	    individuals participate in collective organizations that
	    they might not understand or even perceive, and that these
	    organizations affect and are affected by individual
	    behavior.

  <P>
  <BR>
    Agent-Based Models (ABMs) ... build social structures from the
    ‘bottom-up’, by simulating individuals by virtual agents, and
    creating <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/emergence-how-complex-wholes-emerge-from-simple-parts-20181220/"
    target=new>emergent</a> organizations out of the operation of

    <P>
      ABMs have several attractive features that supplement
      traditional methods for exploring group behavior.
      <ol>
	<li>
	  They are expressed with unambiguous mathematical and
	  computational formalisms so that once they have been fully
	  described, their predictions are clear, quantitative and
	  objective.
	</li>
	<P>
	  <li>
	    They provide true bridging explanations that link two
	    distinct levels of analysis: the properties of individual
	    agents (e.g. their attributes and interactions), and the
	    emergent group-level behavior.  When successful,
	    agent-based models are particularly satisfying models
	    because they show how coherent, group-level structures can
	    spontaneously emerge without leaders ordering the
	    organization, and sometimes despite leaders’
	    effort.
	  </li>
	<P>
	  <li>
	    Because the models are typically either simple or informed

      <BR>
	ABMs consists of a large number of interacting agents,

  <h1>idealized vs. detailed models</h1>

  <P>
  <BR>
    The most fundamental decision an ABM researcher makes is how
    detailed their model will be. Many researchers purposefully choose
    to create highly idealized models that boil down a collective
    phenomenon to its functional essence. Researchers pursuing
    idealized models are typically motivated to describe
    domain-general mechanisms with a wide sphere of application.
    <P>
      A good example of this strategy is
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Axelrod"
    target=new>Robert Axelrod</a>’s Culture Model. The goal of this
    model is to explain how beliefs or attitudes converge or diverge
    in a population over time. Agents are placed at fixed locations
    within a 2D grid, and initially have random trait values on each
    of several features. The likelihood of neighboring agents
    interacting with one another is proportional to their similarity
    across all features. When two agents interact, one of the trait
    values of one of the agents is copied to the other agent, in a
    process that simulates cultural imitation or social influence.
    <P>
      Over time, spatial clusters of like-minded agents develop,
    although some diversity of opinion is often maintained as
    dissimilar agents are unlikely to interact even if they are
    neighbors (see next slide). This simple model can explain (i) the
    spatial clustering of opinions, (ii)
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwagon_effect"
    target=new>bandwagon effects</a>, and (iii) the spontaneous
    division of a culture into sub-cultures.

  <img src="Goldstone05-fig1.png" class="figure-right" height=500>
  <P>
    Four simulations of Axelrod’s Culture Model. Each agent is
    represented by a color that represents their entire set of
    features (e.g. hobby) and trait values (e.g. chess, badminton,
    violin). Agents with identical colors have identical traits. 
    <ol type=a>
      <li>
	An initial, randomly generated population of agents, each
	possessing two traits (TZ2) on each of two features (FZ2). 
      </li>
      <li>
	The same population after 4000 generations of interactions in
	which neighboring agents copy each others’ traits, with the
	probability of interaction proportional to the agents’
	similarity. The population is frozen because the red and green
	agents have no traits in common and hence will never interact.
      </li>
      <li>
	After 4000 generations, a simulation starting with agents
	characterized by two trait values (TZ2) along 15 features
	(FZ15). Increasing the number of features increases the
	probability of a homogeneous, like-minded population
	emerging. 
      </li>
      <li>
	When FZ3 and TZ15, the population quickly becomes frozen into
	small cliques that have no crossgroup interactions. Increasing
	the number of traits per feature decreases the size of
	cliques.

  <h1>example of a detailed model: the Anasazi settlement</h1>

  <P>
    Other ABMs are intimately tied to a specific domain because they
    include a considerable amount of detail derived from real world
    datasets and their goal is answering a specific real-world
    question. One such question is, ‘Why did the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancestral_Puebloans"
    target=new>Anasazi</a> people of southwestern United States
    abandon their homeland around 1350 AD?’
  </P>
  <P>
    The ABM here incorporates features grounded in historical records:
     maize production levels, ground water reserves, the 3D geography
     of the Anasazi’s Long House Valley homeland, populations
     established from archeological digs, and social trends regarding
     childbirth age, the average age of children leaving home, and
     food consumption needs, all based upon recent maize-growing
     societies of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puebloans"
		     target=new>Pueblo Indians</a> descended from the Anasazi.

<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>ABMs (computational) vs. descriptive (mathematical) models</h1>

  <P>
    <BR>
      To create tractable descriptive equations it is often necessary
      to make misleading assumptions that fail to capture essential
      aspects of natural phenomena. One example is the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_field_theory"
      target=new>Mean Field Approximation</a>, according to which all
      individuals in a group are assumed to be in the same location
      and experience the same local environment.
      <P>
	ABMs that incorporate space and local variability frequently
      produce much more realistic models. For example, giving agents
      unique rather than aggregate positions has proven invaluable in
      modeling the continued stability of host-pathogen populations,
      the genetic diversity in a population, and preserved pockets of
      cooperation surrounded by defectors. 
      <P>
	More generally, ABMs often provide more satisfying accounts
      than purely descriptive approaches because they posit mechanisms
      by which aggregate qualities emerge.

<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>three core themes for agent-based models</h1>

  <P>
    Three prevalent themes for computational models of
    collective behavior:
  </P>
  <P>
    <I>Patterns and organization.</I>  Human trails, traffic jams,
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_(audience)"
       target=new>Mexican waves</a>, and panic behavior of
    pedestrians. In these models humans are represented as
    particles with variation in speeds or position, and without
    any requirement of cognition for the agents. These simple
	reactive agent-based simulation models have often provided
    surprisingly apt accounts of empirically observed behavior.
  </P>
  <P>
    <I>Contagion.</I> Social contagion is the spread of an entity or
    influence between individuals in a population via interactions
    between agents. Examples are the spreading of fads, rumors and
    riots. Computational approaches to simulate social contagion are
    based on thresholds models. Each agent has a threshold that, when
    exceeded, leads the agent to adopt an activity.
  </P>
  <P>
    <I>Cooperation.</I>  A social dilemma is a situation where
    sub-optimal group outcomes are achieved if all agents do the
    action that is optimal for themselves. If self-centered rational
    agents do not cooperate in social dilemmas why do we often find
    cooperation in actual case studies? The work of Axelrod on the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma"
       target=new>Prisoner&rsquo;s Dilemma</a> led to a large
       literature on extensions of the original models to include the
       addition of space, indirect reciprocity, and more complex
       strategies. Most of this work uses simple reactive agents. Some
       recent studies focus on more cognitively sophisticated agents
       with designs informed by psychological theories, such as
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_comparison_theory"
       target=new>social comparison</a> and
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounded_rationality"
       target=new>bounded rationality</a>.
  </P>

<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>opportunities for future ABM work</h1>

  <P>
    <I>Modeling large-scale collectives.</I>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data" target=new>"Big
      Data"</a> available from on-line news groups, blogs, social
      network services, chat groups and topical communities can
      effectively be used to explore naturally occurring coalition
    formation, idea spread and group evolution.
  </P>
  <P>
    <I>Computational models as test-beds.</I>  Computational models of
    collective behavior can explore in advance the possible
    consequences of public policy changes. ABMs can be used to address
    ‘what if ’ scenarios like ‘What is the consequence of the spread
    of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019"
    target=new>Covid-19</a> if policies are implemented to affect
    social contacts of potential carriers?’ and ‘What would be the
    impact on world demographics if parents can choose the sex of
    their child?’ As computational simulations become increasingly
    realistic, they will serve as increasingly useful test-beds for
    exploring potential consequences of public policies that have
    complex,
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_system"
	   target=new>non-linear</a> dynamics.
  </P>
  <P>
    <I>Group control through indirect manipulation rather than
      explicit rules.</I> Perhaps the most common method of crowd
      control is through direct orders or laws. If we wish to direct
      pedestrian traffic, for example, we may institute rules or
      physical barriers that prohibit certain movements. The cost of
      such prohibitions is decreased pedestrian morale and the
      perception of excluded possibilities. ABMs suggest an
      alternative method of crowd control by changing the structure of
      the environment such that certain behaviors are facilitated and
      others are indirectly hindered without instituting physical or
      abstract barriers.
