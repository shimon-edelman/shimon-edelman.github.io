<h3>Computing societies</h3>

This is the second part of a two-part course. It focuses on the role
of computational simulation in two disciplines — evolutionary science
and sociology — which are both uniquely important to the understanding
of the world we live in, and at the same time uniquely difficult to
study by the traditional scientific method, which tries to derive
mathematical models from experimental data. In both these domains of
study, scientists often resort to simulation, using an agent-based
modeling (ABM) approach. In evolutionary ABM, simulated actors
(agents) carrying various traits of interest share an environment in
which they undertake actions and compete for resources. The agent’s
cumulative outcomes determine its fitness, which in turn affects its
chances for reproduction. The effectiveness of traits can then be
assessed by tracking their prevalence in the population over
evolutionary time. Similarly, in computational social science, the ABM
approach involves simulated agents with controlled cognitive
abilities, “personalities,” and interpersonal attitudes. The social
dynamics that arises out of the agents’ interactions is then analyzed
and used to support theory development.

<h4>Key information</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    As with Part I, reading comprehension and speaking fluency in
    English is an absolute requirement.  Furthermore, the key
    <B>prerequisite</B> for this part of the course is an ability to write
    code, in any programming language. <B>If you cannot program, you will
    not be able to complete a project and should not take this
    course.</B> We will use the Python programming environment, which can
    be easily mastered by anyone with prior experience in Java,
    Scheme, or any other popular language. Playing with Python before
    the course starts will make it easier for you to keep up with the
    material (see <a href="https://mesa.readthedocs.io/en/master/"
    target=mesa>https://mesa.readthedocs.io/en/master/</a>).
  </li>
  <P>
    <li>
      The course will be taught over a period of 4 weeks, 5 days/week,
      in 1.5-hour <B>units</B>, for a total of 45 hours (see separate
      detailed schedule).
    </li>
  <P>
    <li>
      The required <B>readings</B> are academic papers, which will be made
      available in PDF format, as a zipped archive. You should try to
      read each paper before its assigned date, but please note that
      the papers will be thoroughly explained and discussed in class.
    </li>
  <P>
    <li>
      The <B>final project</B>, due on the last day of class, will
      consist of a summary paper and a presentation of the ABM
      simulation, which you will develop during the course. NOTE:
      group projects (2-3 students per group) will be acceptable.
    </li>
</ul>
