    <B>Abstract</B>
  </P>
  <P>
    "Public policies are designed to have an impact on particular
    societies, yet policy-oriented computer models and simulations
    often focus more on articulating the policies to be applied than
    on realistically rendering the cultural dynamics of the target
    society. This approach can lead to policy assessments that ignore
    crucial social contextual factors. For example, BY LEAVING OUT
    DISTINCTIVE MORAL AND NORMATIVE DIMENSIONS OF CULTURAL CONTEXTS IN
    ARTIFICIAL SOCIETIES, ESTIMATIONS OF DOWNSTREAM POLICY
    EFFECTIVENESS FAIL TO ACCOUNT FOR DYNAMICS THAT ARE FUNDAMENTAL IN
    HUMAN LIFE AND CENTRAL TO MANY PUBLIC POLICY CHALLENGES. In this
    paper, we supply evidence that incorporating morally salient
    dimensions of a culture is critically important for producing
    relevant and accurate evaluations of social policy when using
    multi-agent artificial intelligence models and simulations."

      "Table 1 shows the likelihood that an interaction could occur
      between agents in the normative configurations. A humanities
      scholar expert in identifying social norms generated the
      estimates based on experience, the literature on social norms in
      a western country, and discussions with other scholars."

      "Effects of norms on amount and type of interactions between
      “Source” and “Target” agents for the three configurations:
      Baseline (top), Normative (middle), and Restricted normative
      (bottom).
    </P>
    <P>
      The graph shows that the number of interactions between majority
      and minority subgroups is significantly altered by the
      introduction of norms. The important aspect of this graph is the
      how each configuration is different from the others in terms of
      group to group interactions.  In effect, we are dealing with
      three completely different societies."

      [Experiment 2] "We hypothesize that testing policy in an
      un-normed model as opposed to a normed model will significantly
      alter results. This experiment employs three conditions: The
      BASELINE and NORMATIVE conditions, together with an INCLUSION
      condition that simulates a simple policy to encourage maximum
      interaction between children to promote integration at an early
      age. This amounts to changing Table 1 by inserting a 1 for every
      child-to-child interaction."
    </P>  
    <ul>
      <li>
	<I>Shared Norms</I> is an indication of cultural integration.
      </li>
      <li>
	<I>Outgroup Suspicion</I> is a measure of social integration. 
      </li>
    </ul>
    <P>
      "Compare the NORMATIVE condition with the INCLUSION condition.
      The means for the key integration-related variables are
      virtually identical; indeed, a t-test indicates no significant
      difference. It follows that the significant difference from
      baseline is delivered not by the INCLUSION policy but merely by
      accounting for social norms that govern inter-personal
      interactions."
