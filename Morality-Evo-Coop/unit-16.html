    What is
    <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/morality-definition/"
    target=new>morality</a>? And to what extent does it vary around
    the world? The theory of “morality-as-cooperation” argues that
    morality consists of a collection of biological and cultural
    solutions to the problems of cooperation that arise in human
    social life. It draws on the theory of
    non-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum_game"
    target=new>zero-sum</a> games and predicts that specific forms of
    cooperative behavior —
  </P>
  <P>
    <ol>
      <li>
	helping kin
      </li>
      <li>
	helping your
	group
      </li>
      <li>
	reciprocating
      </li>
      <li>

      </li>
      <li>
	deferring to superiors

      </li>
      <li>
	respecting prior possession
      </li>
    </ol>
  </P>
  <P>
    — will be considered morally good wherever they arise, in all
    cultures. To test these predictions, we investigate the moral
    valence of these seven cooperative behaviors in the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnography"
    target=new>ethnographic</a> records of 60 societies.
  </P>

  <h1>types of cooperation: 1</h1>

  <P>
    <B>Allocation of Resources to Kin (Family Values)</B>.  Genes that
    benefit replicas of themselves in other individuals — that is,
    genetic relatives — will be favored by natural selection if the
    cost of helping is outweighed by the benefit to the recipient
    gene(s). So, under some conditions organisms will possess
    adaptations for detecting and delivering benefits (or avoiding
    doing harm) to kin.
  </P>
  <P>
    This theory of kin selection explains many instances of altruism,
    in many species, including humans.  Morality-as-cooperation leads
    us to expect that this type of cooperative behavior — caring for
    offspring, helping family members, and avoiding inbreeding — will
    be regarded as morally good.
  </P>

</div>



<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>types of cooperation: 2</h1>

  <P>
    <B>Coordination to Mutual Advantage (Group Loyalty).</B>  Game
    theory models situations in which individuals are uncertain about
    how to behave to bring about a mutual benefit as coordination
    problems. Humans and other animals use a variety of strategies —
    such as
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focal_point_(game_theory)"
    target=new>focal points</a>, traditions, leadership, signaling,
    badges of membership, and
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_mind"
    target=new>“theory of mind”</a> — to solve these problems and form
    stable coalitions and alliances.
  </P>
  <P>
    Morality-as-cooperation leads us to expect that this type of
    cooperative behavior — forming friendships, participating in
    collaborative endeavors, favoring your own group, and adopting
    local conventions — will be regarded as morally good.
  </P>

</div>



<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>types of cooperation: 3</h1>
  
  <P>
    <B>Social Exchange (Reciprocity)</B>.  In game theory, social
    dilemmas —
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma"
    target=new>prisoners’ dilemmas</a>, public goods games,
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons"
    target=new>tragedies of the commons</a> — arise when the fruits of
    cooperation are vulnerable to exploitation by
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-rider_problem"
    target=new>“free riders”</a>, who accept the benefit of
    cooperation without paying the cost. This problem can be overcome
    by a strategy of “conditional cooperation” or “reciprocal
    altruism,” such as
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tit_for_tat"
       target=new>tit-for-tat</a>.
  </P>
  <P>
    Morality-as-cooperation leads us to expect that this type of
    cooperative behavior — trusting others, reciprocating favors,
    seeking revenge, expressing gratitude, andmaking amends — will be
    regarded as morally good.

<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>types of cooperation: 4, 5</h1>

  <P>
    <B>Contests between Hawks (Bravery) and Doves (Respect)</B>.
    Conflict over resources — food, territory, and mates — presents
    organisms with an opportunity to cooperate by competing in less
    mutually destructive ways. There are three ways of achieving this:
    <I>contests</I> (featuring the display of
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawk"
    target=new>hawkish</a> and
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbidae"
    target=new>dovish</a> traits),
    <I>division</I>, and <I>respecting possession</I>.  Game theory
    has shown that conflicts can be settled through “contests,” in
    which individuals display
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handicap_principle"
    target=new>reliable indicators</a> of their “fighting ability,”
    and defer to the stronger party.
  </P>
  <P>
    Morality-as-cooperation leads us to expect that these types of
    cooperative behavior — hawkish displays of dominance (the “heroic
    virtues” of bravery, fortitude, skill, and wit) and dovish
    displays of submission (the “monkish virtues” of humility,
    deference, obedience, and respect) — will be regarded as morally
    good.
  </P>

</div>



<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>types of cooperation: 6</h1>

  <P>
    <B>Division (Fairness).</B>  When the contested resource is
    divisible, game theory models the situation as a “bargaining
    problem”. Here, one solution is to divide the resource in
    proportion to the relative (bargaining) power of the
    protagonists. Rules such as “I cut, you choose,” “meet in the
    middle,” “split the difference,” and “take turns” are ancient and
    widespread means of resolving disputes.  And “equal shares” is a
    spontaneous and cross-culturally prevalent decision rule in
    economic games and similar situations.
  </P>
  <P>
    Morality-as-cooperation leads us to expect that this type of
    cooperative behavior — dividing disputed resources, reaching a
    compromise, being fair — will be regarded as morally good.
  </P>

</div>


<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>types of cooperation: 7</h1>
  
  <P>
    <B>Possession (Property Rights).</B>  Finally, game theory shows
    that conflicts over resources can be resolved by recognition of
    prior possession.  Humans defer to prior possession in vignette
    studies, experimental games, the law, and international
    relations. Private property, in some form or other, appears to be
    a cross-cultural universal.
  </P>
  <P>
    Morality-as-cooperation leads us to expect that this type of
    cooperative behavior — deferring to prior possession — will be
    regarded as morally good.
  </P>
   
</DIV>    
    


<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>the present study: motivation</h1>

  <P>
    Although much evidence for the universality of cooperation had
    been gathered before, the previous studies were not designed to,
    and indeed do not, test fully morality-as-cooperation’s specific
    predictions.
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_anthropology"
    target=new>Comparative anthropology</a> has not systematically
    assessed the moral valence of all seven forms of cooperative
    behavior: moral values relating to hawkish and dovish traits in
    the adult population, and dividing disputed resources, are
    conspicuously absent from the literature.
  </P>
  <P>
    And no previous questionnaire research has evaluated all seven
    types of cooperative behavior posited by the theory: existing
    scales typically measure something other than moral valence (e.g.,
    they ask whether a person or a society possesses a particular
    trait, rather than whether the trait is moral); and the disparate
    samples are typically university students, or people in Western,
    educated, industrialized, rich, democratic
    (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology#WEIRD_bias"
    target=new>WEIRD</a>) societies, or people with access to the
    internet, which limits their external validity and
    generalizability to “humanity” at large.
  </P>

</div>


<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>the present study: outline</h1>
  
  <P>
    And so, to test our predictions, to overcome the limitations of
    previous research, and to resolve lingering uncertainty over
    cross-cultural variation in moral values, we surveyed the moral
    valence of <I>the seven cooperative behaviors</I> in a single,
    homogenous, coherent source of high-quality ethnographic data,
    collected from a sample of 60 societies specifically chosen to
    provide as representative a sample of humanity as possible.
  </P>
  <P>
    In addition to reporting the moral valence of these cooperative
    behaviors, we also report their cross-societal frequency and
    distribution. After all, it is possible that even if
    morality-as-cooperation’s predictions regarding the moral valence
    of cooperative behaviors are supported, these behaviors and their
    corresponding moral values may still turn out to be rare, present
    in relatively few societies, or in only some regions but not
    others.

  </P>
  <P>
    First, we extracted paragraph-level ethnographic materials indexed
    by professional anthropologists for the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Relations_Area_Files"
    target=new>eHRAF</a> as Ethics or Norms. The extraction extraction
    of materials indexed as Ethics resulted in 2,519 paragraphs from
    400 documents across the 60 societies sampled. The extraction of
    materials indexed as Norms resulted in 1,605 paragraphs from 263
    discrete documents across 58 of the societies sampled.
  </P>
  <P>
    Second, the entire archive was searched using a combination of
    relevant indexical headings (e.g., “Mutual Aid”) and keyword
    combinations. This phase identified 1,737 paragraphs from 355
    discrete documents across the 60 societies. When duplicate
    paragraphs were removed (i.e., 2,401 paragraphs identified in more
    than one phase), we were left with a total of 3,460 paragraphs,
    containing 606,556 words, from 603 unique sources, published over
    a period spanning 300 years.
  </P>

<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>coding the ethnographic data</h1>

  <P>
    The coding procedure involved making 24,220 (3,460 \(\times\) 7)
    coding decisions — that is, deciding whether or not each of the
    3,460 paragraphs indicated that any of the seven cooperative
    behaviors had a positive or negative moral valence.  Raters 1 and
    2 (two of the authors) independently coded the full set of 3,460
    paragraphs and then conferred to resolve ambiguities and
    discrepancies. This resulted in a total of 1,426 paragraphs that
    contained material germane to one or more moral domain.
  </P>
  <P>
    A hypothesis-blind independent coder (rater 3) then coded each of
    these 1,426 paragraphs before discussing coding discrepancieswith
    raters 1 and 2. Of the 1,426 \(\times\) 7 = 9,982 initial coding
    decisions compared between the two sets of codes, there were 8,704
    decisions in agreement and 1,278 decisions on which the raters
    disagreed—thus there was “moderate”
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohen%27s_kappa"
    target=new>agreement</a> between the two initial sets of ratings
    overall (\(\kappa = .58, P < .005\)).
  </P>
  <P>
    Raters 1, 2, and 3 then met to discuss and analyze discrepancies
    using the resolution method. On closer inspection it was
    discovered that the poor level of agreement with regard to
    “dividing disputed resources” was the result of rater 3 including
    cases of generic “sharing.” These and other rating discrepancies
    were reviewed and resolved until complete agreement was reached
    (\(\kappa = 1\)).  In the final analysis, of the 3,460 paragraphs
    reviewed, 761 contained information about the moral valence of one
    or more of the seven cooperative behaviors. This gave rise to 962
    observations of moral valence in total.

  <P>
    <I>The instructions to coders:</I> “Please read through the
    following paragraphs. Your task is to decide, for each paragraph,
    whether it contains evidence that any of seven behaviors explained
    in table 1 is considered morally good or bad. <small> ‘Moral goodness’ may
    be indicated by comments to the effect that the particular
    behavior is good, right,moral, ethical, or virtuous, or that it is
    an obligation, duty, or moral norm, and so on. It may also be
    indicated by morally-valenced words. For example, the mere mention
    of ‘family loyalty,’ or ‘property rights’ would suffice. Moral
    goodness can also be indicated by evidence that not performing the
    particular behavior is bad, wrong, immoral or unethical,
    etc. Similarly, moral badness maybe indicated by comments to the
    effect that the particular behavior is bad, wrong, immoral,
    unethical, or sinful, or that it is taboo, shameful, prohibited,
    and so on.  If there is evidence that the particular behavior is
    considered morally good, then type ‘1’ in the adjacent box. If the
    behavior is considered morally wrong, then type ‘—1.’ Please bear

  </P>
  <P>
    In 961 out of 962 observations (99.9%), cooperative behavior had a
    positive moral valence. The one exception to the rule — among the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuuk_State"
    target=new>Chuuk</a>, “to steal openly from others is admirable in
    that it shows a person’s dominance and demonstrates that he is not
    intimidated by the aggressive powers of others” — appears to be a
    case in which one form of cooperation (respect for property) has
    been trumped by another (respect for a hawkish trait, although not
    explicitly bravery).
  </P>
  <P>
    <small>
      There were 18 other examples of these seven moral values coming
      into conflict: nine examples of conflict between helping family
      and helping group; two of conflict between helping family and
      being brave; two of conflict between helping family and
      deferring to authority; and one example each of conflict between
      helping family and reciprocating, helping group and being brave,
      reciprocating and being brave, being brave and being
      deferential, and being deferential and respecting possession.
      However, in these cases, the moral values were portrayed as
      being in conflict, rather than one being good and the other bad.

    There were significantly more societies in which “property” was

    nonsignificant. There were no societies in which any of the seven
    cooperative behaviors had a negative moral valence. (The
    “exception” reported above was itself an exception—seven other
    paragraphs attested to the positive moral valence of property
    among the Chuuk).
  </P>
  <P>
    When aggregated by cultural region, all seven positively morally
    valenced cooperative behaviors were observed in all six regions —
    with the sole exception of “dividing disputed resources” in
    Central America (for which there were no data). Crucially, the
    positively morally valenced cooperative behaviors were observed
    with equal frequency in all regions.

</DIV>    
    


<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>conclusions</h1>

  <P>
    A survey of 60 diverse societies found that the moral valence of
    seven cooperative behaviors was uniformly positive. In every
    society for which there were data, these seven cooperative
    behaviors behaviors were considered morally good. There were no
    counterexamples, that is, societies in which these behaviors were
    considered morally bad. The survey also found that these
    cooperative morals were widespread — with most appearing in most
    societies — and that they were observed with equal frequency
    across all cultural regions.
  </P>
  <P>
    As such, these results provide strong support for the theory of
    morality-as-cooperation, and no support for the more extreme
    versions of
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_relativism"
    target=new>moral relativism</a>. In short,
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hume"
    target=new>Hume</a> was right, and
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Locke"
    target=new>Locke</a> was wrong. When you “look abroad into the
    several tribes of men” there are some widely held morals that are
    not elsewhere “slighted or condemned,” and they include precisely
    those morals predicted by morality-as-cooperation.  As
    <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/9662/9662-h/9662-h.htm"
    target=new>Hume (1748)</a> put it: “history informs us of nothing
    new or strange in this particular.”
