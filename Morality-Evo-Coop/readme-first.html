<h3>Computing societies</h3>

This is the second part of a two-part
course, <a href="Edelman-CIS-syllabus.pdf" target=new><I>Computational
foundations of mind, evolution, and society</I></a>. It focuses on the
role of computational simulation in several disciplines — evolutionary
science, economics, political science, and sociology — which are all
uniquely important to the understanding of the world we live in, and
at the same time uniquely difficult to study by the traditional
scientific method, which tries to derive mathematical models from
experimental data. In these domains of study, scientists often resort
to simulation, using an agent-based modeling (ABM) approach. In ABM
studies, simulated actors (agents) carrying various traits of interest
share an environment in which they undertake actions and compete for
resources. In an evolutionary setting, an agent’s cumulative outcomes
determine its fitness, which in turn affects its chances for
reproduction. The effectiveness of traits can then be assessed by
tracking their prevalence in the population over evolutionary time.
Similarly, in computational social science, the ABM approach involves
simulated agents with controlled cognitive abilities, “personalities,”
and interpersonal attitudes. The social dynamics that arises out of
the agents’ interactions is then analyzed and used to support theory
development.

<ul>
  <li>
    As with Part I, reading comprehension and speaking fluency in
    English is an absolute requirement.  
  </li>
  <P>
    <li>
      The course will be taught over a period of 4 weeks, 5 days/week,
      in 1.5-hour <B>units</B>, for a total of 45 hours.
    </li>
  <P>
    <li>
      The required <B>readings</B> are academic papers, which
      are <a href="readings.zip" target=new>available</a> in PDF
      format, as a zipped archive. You should try to read each paper
      before its assigned date, but please note that the papers will
      be thoroughly explained and discussed in class.
    </li>
  <P>
    <li>
      <P>
	The <B>final project</B>, due on the last day of class, will
	consist of a summary paper and a presentation.
      </P>

	[Alternatively, those who are able to write code, can choose to
	implement an ABM model using the Mesa/Python environment
	(see <a href="https://mesa.readthedocs.io/en/master/"
	target=mesa>https://mesa.readthedocs.io/en/master/</a>). In
	this case, group projects (2-3 students per group) will be
	acceptable.]
