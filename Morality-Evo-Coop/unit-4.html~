  <h1>From factors to actors: computational sociology and agent-based modeling [Macy & Willer, 2002]</h1>

  <P>
    <BR>
      Sociologists often model social processes as
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction_(statistics)"
	 target=new>interactions among variables</a>.  We review an
      alternative approach that models social life as interactions among
      adaptive agents who influence one another in response to the
      influence they receive.
    </P>
  <P>
    These agent-based models (ABMs) show how simple and predictable
    local interactions can generate familiar but enigmatic global
    patterns, such as the diffusion of information, emergence of
    norms, coordination of conventions, or participation in collective
    action.  <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/emergence-how-complex-wholes-emerge-from-simple-parts-20181220/"
    target=new>Emergent</a> social patterns can also appear
    unexpectedly and then just as dramatically transform or disappear,
    as happens in revolutions, market crashes,
    <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/fad#Noun"
    target=new>fads</a>, and
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feeding_frenzy"

  <h1>motivation: the flocking of geese</h1>

  <table>
    <tr>
      <td>
	Consider a flock of
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goose"
	target=new>geese</a> flying in tight formation. Collectively
	they form the image of a giant delta-shaped bird that moves as
	purposively as if it were a single organism. Yet the flock has
	no "group mind" nor is there a "leader bird" choreographing
	the formation. Rather, each bird reacts to the movement of its
	immediate neighbors who in turn react to it. The result is the

<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>boids</h1>

  <P>
  If we tried to model the elegance of the flock at the
  global<sup>*</sup> level, the effort would be misleading because the
  flock is not governed by a system-wide program.  Moreover, the task
  would be immensely difficult because of the extreme complexity of a
  nonlinear system. Yet the task turns out to be remarkably easy if
  instead we model the flock as the aggregation of local interactions.
  <P>
    This was demonstrated by
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Reynolds_(computer_graphics)"
    target=new>Craig Reynolds</a> (1987) when he modeled the
    movement of a population of artificial
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids"
    target=new>"boids"</a> based on three simple rules:
    <ul>
      <li><I>Separation:</I> Don’t get too close to any object,
	including other boids.
      </li>
      <li>
	<I>Alignment:</I> Try to match the speed and direction of
	nearby boids.
      </li>
      <li>
	<I>Cohesion:</I> Head for the perceived center of mass of the
	boids in your immediate neighborhood.
      </li>
    </ul>
  <P>
    Had Reynolds chosen instead to write a top-down program for the
    global behavior of the flock, he might still be working on it.
  <P>
    Note that Reynolds did not model the flock, nor did he model
    isolated birds. He modeled their <I>interaction</I>, at the
    relational level.

<hr align=left width=30%>

<small>
  "Global" refers to population-level dynamics that
  determine the macro behavior of the flock, while "local" refers to
  micro processes at the level of individuals interacting with
  neighbors.

  <h1>ABMs and sociology</h1>

  <P>
  <BR>
    Agent-based models (ABMs) of human social interaction are based on
    this same theory-building strategy. Sociologists have
    traditionally understood social life as a
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchy"
    target=new>hierarchical</a> system of institutions and norms that
    shape individual behavior from the top down. Interest in ABMs
    reflects growing interest in the possibility that human groups,
    like flocks of birds, may be highly complex, nonlinear,
    path-dependent, and
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-organization"
    target=new>self-organizing</a>. We may be able to understand these
    dynamics much better by trying to model them, not at the global
    level but instead
    as <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/emergence-how-complex-wholes-emerge-from-simple-parts-20181220/"
    target=new>emergent</a> properties of local interaction among
    adaptive agents who influence one another in response to the
    influence they receive.
  </P>
  <P>
    Although sociology has lagged behind other social sciences in
    appreciating this new methodology, a distinctive sociological
    contribution is evident in the papers we review. <I>First</I>,
    theoretical interest focuses on dynamic social networks that shape
    and are shaped by agent interaction. <I>Second</I>, ABMs are used
    to perform virtual experiments that test macrosociological
    theories by manipulating structural factors such as network
    topology, social stratification, or spatial mobility.
  </P>

<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>ABM simulation in sociology</h1>

  <P>
  <BR>
  The third wave in social simulation, agent-based modeling, coincided
  with the advent of the personal computer in the 1980s. Like
  microsimulation, these bottom-up models explored the
  microfoundations of global patterns. The difference is that, unlike
  the socially isolated actors in microanalytical simulation, the
  agents now interact interdependently.
  <P>
    ABMs impose four key assumptions:
    <ol>
      <li>
	<I>Agents are autonomous.</I>  Systemic patterns emerge from
	the bottom up, coordinated not by centralized authorities or
	institutions (although these may exist as environmental
	constraints) but by local interactions among autonomous
	decision-makers.  This process is known as
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-organization"
	   target=new>"self-organization"</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
	<I>Agents are interdependent.</I> Interdependence may involve
	processes like persuasion, sanctioning, and imitation, in
	which agents influence others in response to the influence
	that they receive. Interdependence may also be indirect, as
	when agents&rsquo; behaviors change some aspect of the
	environment, which in turn affects the behavior of other
	agents, such that the consequences of each agent&rsquo;s
	decisions depend in part on the choices of others.
      </li>
    </ol>
  
</DIV>



<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>ABM simulation in sociology (cont.)</h1>

  <P>
  <BR>
  <ol start=3>
    <li>
      <I>Agents follow simple rules.</I> Global complexity does not
      necessarily reflect the cognitive complexity of
      individuals. Although the rules [that guide individual behavior]
      may be quite simple, they can produce global patterns that may
      not be at all obvious and are very difficult to understand (like
      Reynolds&rsquo; "boids"). ABMs explore the simplest set of
      behavioral assumptions required to generate a macro pattern of
      explanatory interest.
    </li>
    <li>
      <I>Agents are adaptive and backward-looking.</I> When
      interdependent agents are also adaptive, their interaction can
      generate a
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_adaptive_system"
      target=new>"complex adaptive system"</a>. Agents adapt by
      moving, imitating, replicating, or learning, but not by
      calculating the most efficient action. They can adapt at two
      levels, the individual and the population.  Individuals learn
      through processes
      like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning"
      target=new>reinforcement</a>,
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_optimization"
      target=new>Bayesian updating</a>, or the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation"
      target=new>back-propagation of error</a> in artificial neural
      networks. Learning alters the probability distribution of
      behaviors competing for attention within each individual.
      Populations learn through evolutionary processes of selection,
      imitation, and social influence. Evolution alters the frequency
      distribution of agent-types competing for reproduction within a
      population.

  <h1>from prediction to explanation</h1>

  <P>
  <BR>
  Unlike earlier approaches to computer simulation, whose value
  depends largely on predictive accuracy, agent-based models are much
  more concerned with theoretical development and <I>explanation</I>
  than with prediction.
  <P>
  The power of emergence:
  <DIR><DIR> 
      The macrosocial outcome is also more than the sum of its
      parts. This concept, known as emergence, was anticipated by
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89mile_Durkheim"
      target=new>Durkheim</a> (1901): "The hardness of
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze"
      target=new>bronze</a> lies neither in the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper"
      target=new>copper</a>, nor the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin" target=new>tin</a>,
      nor in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"
      target=new>lead</a> which have been used to form it, which are
      all soft or malleable bodies. The hardness arises from the
      mixing of them".
      <P>
	"[Social] facts reside in the society itself that produces
	them and not in its parts — namely, its members."
    </DIR></DIR>
    <P>
      Without a model of the microfoundations of emergent properties,
      path-dependent self-organizing processes (such as informal
      social control) are likely to be mistaken for institutions that
      are globally coordinated (such as bureaucratic controls in
      formal organizations). 
    <P>
      ABMs defy classification as either micro or macro but instead
      provide a theoretical bridge between levels.

  <h1>two complementary phenomena</h1>

  <P>
  <BR>
    <B>Emergent structure.</B> In these models, agents and
    agent-behaviors move through social and physical space in response
    to social influences and selection pressures. Agents may start out
    undifferentiated and then change location or behavior so as to
    avoid becoming different or isolated (or in some cases,
    overcrowded). Rather than producing homogeneity, however, these
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformity"
    target=new>conformist</a> decisions may aggregate to produce
    global patterns of
    <I>cultural differentiation</I>, <I>stratification</I>, and
    <I>homophilous clustering</I> in social networks.  Other studies
    reverse the process, starting with a heterogeneous population and
    ending in convergence: the coordination, diffusion, and sudden
    collapse of norms, institutions, beliefs, innovations, standards,
    etc.
    <P>
    <B>Emergent social order.</B> These studies show how egoistic
    adaptation can lead to successful collective action without either
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altruism"
    target=new>altruism</a> or global (top-down) imposition of
    control. A key finding across numerous studies is that the
    viability of trust, cooperation, and collective action depends
    decisively on the social embeddedness of interaction.

  <h1>ABM design questions</h1>

  <ol>
    <li>Is interaction global or local, that is, is the population
      fully connected or is interaction constrained by the structure
      of social ties?</li>
    <li>If interaction is local, are the constraints on tie
      formation spatial or social?</li> 
    <li>Are ties elective (formed and broken through movement, exit,
      or assortative mating) or is interaction forced?  </li>
    <li>Is adaptation based on learning (which modifies the
      probability distribution of behaviors in each agent&rsquo;s
      repertoire) or evolution (which modifies the frequency
      distribution of behaviors across the population of agents)?</li>
    <li>If evolution, does reproduction involve
      competition for survival or social influence?</li>
    <li>If influence, is this limited to external states of the agent
      (e.g., behavior) or do agents copy other agents&rsquo; internal
      programming, even though this cannot be directly observed?</li>
    <li>Is influence based on attainment (success, fitness, payoffs,
      status) or familiarity (proximity, frequency)?</li>
    <li>Is the model used as an experiment (parameters are
      manipulated to test for predicted differences) or a
      demonstration (parameters are manipulated to test for
      predicted robustness)? </li>
    <li>If used experimentally, are the manipulations mainly of
      agent-level parameters (to test a micro theory about the

<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>social influence and the paradox of mimetic divergence</h1>

      Two examples of unexpected results:
      <ul>
	<li>
	  Latane’s (1996) Social Impact Model uses a rule to mimic
	  one’s neighbors in a two-dimensional lattice. From a random
	  start, a population of mimics might be expected to converge
	  inexorably on a single profile, leading to the conclusion
	  that cultural diversity is imposed by factors that
	  counteract the effects of
	  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformity"
	  target=new>conformist</a> tendencies. However,
	  the <I>surprising result</I> was that "the system achieved
	  stable diversity. The minority was able to survive, contrary
	  to the belief that social influence inexorably leads to
	  uniformity."
	</li>
	<li>
	  Carley’s (1991) and Axelrod’s (1997) models couple local
	  influence (the tendency for people who interact frequently
	  to become more similar over time) and homophily (the
	  tendency to interact more frequently with similar
	  agents). This closes the loop — the more agents interact,
	  the more similar they become, and the more similar they
	  become, the more likely they are to interact. More
	  precisely, neighboring agents on a two-dimensional lattice
	  interact with a likelihood determined by the similarity of
	  their cultural traits (given by a simple, randomly assigned
	  string of numbers). Interaction, in turn, reduces remaining
	  differences. Axelrod expected this self-reinforcing dynamic
	  would lead inexorably to cultural convergence and
	  homogeneity. Again <I>the result was surprising</I>. He
	  found that "local convergence can lead to global
	  polarization" and that unique subcultures can survive in the
	  face of a seemingly relentless march toward cultural
	  conformity. Stable minority subcultures persist because of
	  the protection of structural holes created by cultural
	  differences that preclude interaction, thereby insulating
	  agents from homogenizing tendencies.
	</li>
      </ul>
  
</DIV>



<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>social pressure</h1>

  <P>
    <BR>
      More surprises:
      <ul>
	<li>
	  Kim & Bearman (1997) model collective action among agents
	  whose interest in the public good is heavily influenced by
	  social pressure from other participants in their local
	  network. This causes interest in the collective action to
	  spread like a contagion through network channels.  The
	  authors find that participation spreads most effectively
	  within densely clustered subnetworks comprising a critical
	  mass of highly interested primary contributors.
	  <P>
	    This study reflects the conventional wisdom that social
	    pressure to participate is needed to overcome the
	    temptation to free ride. It follows that dependence on the
	    group for social direction promotes compliance with group
	    obligations. Yet a number of
	    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnography"
	    target=new>ethnographic</a> studies of deviant cliques
	    have shown that conformist pressures can also undermine
	    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normative"
	    target=new>normative</a> compliance, leading to badly
	    suboptimal outcomes for all group members, including the
	    deviants. This led Flache & Macy (1996) to investigate the
	    possibility that <I>dependence on peer approval can
	    backfire</I>, leading to collective action failure rather
	    than success.
	  </li>
	</ul>
  
</DIV>



<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>in conclusion: some methodological recommendations</h1>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <I>Start it simple.</I> Analysis of very simple and unrealistic
      models can reveal new theoretical ideas that have broad
      applicability, beyond the stylized models that produced
      them. Pressure to make models more realistic (and agents more
      cognitively sophisticated) is misguided if models become so
      complex that they are as difficult to interpret as natural
      phenomena. ... Models should start out simple and complications
      should be added one at a time, making sure that the dynamics are
      fully understood before proceeding.
    </li>
    <li>
      <I>Avoid reliance on biological metaphors.</I> Is cultural
      evolution the same as genetic? What is the mechanism that
      eliminates poor performers from the population and allows others
      to propagate?  Imitation of the fittest may be more applicable
      than starvation and reproduction, but unlike survival of the
      fittest, mimetic selection replicates only observed behavior and
      does not copy the underlying (unobservable) rules. Biological
      metaphors paper over the importance of this distinction. For
      example, in repeated
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma"
      target=new>Prisoner’s Dilemma</a> games, it is plausible that an
      agent observes and then copies the cooperative behavior of
      successful neighbors, but how does the agent know that this
      behavior is based on a rule (or supergame strategy) like
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tit_for_tat"
      target=new>Tit for Tat</a> and not
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Win%E2%80%93stay,_lose%E2%80%93switch"
      target=new>Win-Stay, Lose-Shift</a> or Always Cooperate that
      generate identical behavior with cooperative partners?
    </li>
  </ol>
  
</DIV>



<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>in conclusion: some methodological recommendations (cont.)</h1>

  <ol start=3>
    <li>
      <I>Experiment, don’t just explore.</I> Agent-based modeling is
      an experimental tool for theoretical research. While important
      discoveries can be made by open-ended exploration of theoretical
      possibilities, researchers need to resist the temptation to
      become freewheeling adventurers in artificial worlds.  Careful,
      systematic mapping of a parameter space may be less engaging,
      but it makes for better science. This requires theoretically
      motivated manipulation of parameters, based on careful review of
      current theoretical and empirical knowledge, and a clear
      statement of the hypotheses that guided the experimental design.
    </li>
    <li>
      <I>Test robustness.</I> Although simulation designs should use
      experimental rather than post-hoc statistical controls to
      identify underlying causal processes, that does not mean
      researchers should avoid statistical analysis of the results.
      On the contrary, ABMs, especially those that include stochastic
      algorithms, require replications that demonstrate the stability
      of the results. Where possible, replications should include
      variation in parameters that are theoretically arbitrary or of
      secondary interest. Authors then need to be careful to
      distinguish between experimental manipulations (where results
      are expected to change with the parameters) and robustness tests
      (where they are not).  
    </li>
    <li>
      <I>Test external validity.</I> Virtual experiments test the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_validity"
      target=new>internal validity</a> of a theory, without which
      there is no need to test the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_validity"
      target=new>external validity</a>. However, this does not mean
      there is never such a need. ABMs are often used to grow familiar
      macrosocial patterns, as a way to identify possible causal
      mechanisms. When this succeeds, researchers need to think about
      ways these mechanisms can be operationalized and tested in
      laboratory or natural conditions.
    </li>
  </ol>

</DIV


<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>in conclusion: some methodological recommendations (cont.)</h1>

  <ol start=6>
    <li>
      <I>Test domain validity.</I> Do two different models of the same
      phenomenon produce the same results? If they do not, find out
      why. Identify the assumptions that are the logical source of
      divergent implications by carefully aligning the
      models. 
    </li>
    <li>
      <I>Bring factors back in.</I> The bottom-up approach in ABMs
      might seem to imply that these models can only be used to test
      microsociological theories.  That is a tragic misunderstanding
      because it precludes what is most exciting to sociologists about
      this methodology. An artificial world populated by computational
      agents is a laboratory in which researchers can manipulate
      structural conditions to test macrosociological theories without
      <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/reification"
      target=new>reifying</a> causal factors at the macro
      level. Contrary to the
      <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/holistic"
      target=new>holistic</a>
      <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/epistemology"
      target=new>epistemology</a> of an earlier generation of
      equation-based simulations, changes in population density or
      network structure, for example, do not directly lead to the
      diffusion of innovations. The causal process is effected through
      individual choices.  Computational experiments in virtual worlds
      provide a rigorous methodology for studying the microfoundations
      of macro dynamics. However, the shift from factors to actors
      should not limit experimenters to manipulation of agent
      attributes (such as cognitive or behavioral
      assumptions). Bringing factors back in as experimental
      manipulations will realize the full potential of agent-based
      modeling, especially in sociology.
