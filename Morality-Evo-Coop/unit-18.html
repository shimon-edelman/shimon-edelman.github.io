  <h1>the goal: replicating and extending the work of Boyd et al.</h1>

  <P>
    As in the Boyd model [see <a href="unit-9.html">Unit 9</a>], here
    groups of agents undergo the stages of signaling, cooperation, and
    punishment. Each agent has a running count of payoff, which may
    change at each stage. The groups split up every 25 "years", and a
    new generation of agents replaces the previous one and forms new
    groups. The proportion of punishers and non-punishers in each
    generation is determined by their comparative fitness in the
    previous generation.  The simulation has the following parameters:
    <ul>
      <li>
	Initial proportion of punishers in the population.
      </li>
      <li>
	Threshold proportion of punishers needed for punishment to
	occur.
      </li>
      <li>
	Benefit from cooperation (ratio of value obtained from a
	cooperative act to cost to cooperating agents).
      </li>
      <li>
	Cost to defecting agents.
      </li>
      <li>
	Cost to punishers (divided among all punishers in the group).
      </li>
      <li>
	Number of groups of agents.

      <li>
	Number of agents in each group.

    <P>
      The proportion of punishers in the population changed over the
      course of the simulation. The pattern of change followed one of
      the following trends, depending on the parameters settings:
      <ol type=a>
	<li>
	  Decreased to 0.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Decreased until a certain point, then remained in a steady
	  state.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Increased exponentially until a certain point, then remained
	  in a steady state.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Increased exponentially until a certain point, then
	  continued to increase at a slower rate, becoming
	  asymptotically closer to 100%.

    <P>
      If threshold proportion is too high compared to initial
      proportion of punishers, no groups or very few groups reach the
      threshold, so punishers are unable to retaliate against
      defectors, and therefore have no use. The proportion of
      punishers decreases to 0
      (outcome <B><font color=black>a</font></B>).
    </P>
    <P>
      If threshold proportion is lower than initial proportion, the
      proportion of punishers decreases from the original level before
      eventually reaching a steady state
      (outcome <B><font color=red>b</font></B>).
    </P>
    <P>
      If there is a good balance between threshold proportion and
      initial proportion, the proportion of punishers increases and

      If benefit from cooperation is low, cooperation does not make
      enough of a difference to make up for the cost to

    </P>

      If benefit from cooperation is high and cost to punishers is

    </P>
    <P>
      If threshold proportion is high, few groups have enough

    <P>
      Previously, Boyd et al. found that the final proportion of
      punishers reached once the simulation was in its steady state
      depended on the threshold proportion needed for punishment to
      occur.
    </P>
    <P>
      Likewise, in this version of the simulation, a higher threshold
      proportion resulted in a higher final proportion of
      punishers. The final proportion tended to be slightly higher
      than the threshold proportion.
    </P>

<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>final proportion of punishers vs. cost to defectors</h1>

  <img src="Smirnova19-fig4.png" class="figure-right" height=400>
  <P>
    In Boyd's version of the simulation, an agents’ choice to
    cooperate or defect was influenced only by whether or not
    defecting agents were punished in the previous round. The extent
    of the punishment did not influence the decision.
  </P>
  <P>
    I [Smirnova] replicated this in my version of the simulation,
    leading to a counterintuitive result: a higher cost to defectors
    did not lead to a higher proportion of punishers in the
    population; rather, it led to a lower one.

<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>possible future directions: improving the mechanics of the model</h1>

  <P>
    The current implementation of reproduction in the model determines
    the proportion of punishers and non-punishers in the next
    generation based on the respective success of these groups in the
    previous generation. This method of modeling reproduction was
    chosen because it gives smoother and more consistent results than
    modeling reproduction on an individual basis. Moreover, agents can
    only reproduce at the end of each generational cycle. The
    simulation could potentially be improved by modeling reproduction
    more realistically. For instance, an agent could be required to
    have fitness above a certain threshold in order to produce
    offspring. Reproducing would cause the agent’s fitness to
    decrease, and it could not reproduce again until its fitness
    increased to the required level again.
  </P>
  <P>
    Boyd's version of the simulation modeled the decision of whether
    to defect or cooperate as independent of the cost to the
    defectors. Thus, incurring a higher cost to defectors actually
    harmed punishers more than non-punishers. Choosing to model the
    probability of defecting as a function of cost to defectors would
    allow varying this parameter to have meaningful results on the
    outcome of the simulation.

<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>possible future directions: modeling secrecy and shame</h1>

  <P>
    What role do secrecy and <B>shame</B> play in morality? One way to
    address this question may be this: at randomly chosen times,
    certain agents become “invisible” [compare this to the mythical
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_of_Gyges"
    target=new>Ring of Gyges</a>], so that potential punishers cannot
    catch them in the act. Invisible agents are aware that they cannot
    be seen – however, because we do not always know when someone may
    be watching, there is a small chance that they may be mistaken and
    believe that they are invisible when, in reality, they are
    not. The way an agent behaves when invisible (in other words, the
    chance of cooperation vs. defection) would be a heritable trait,
    because the model intends to show how agents can evolve to take
    advantage of the ability to hide from society.
  </P>
  <P>
    Agents who defect, either because they falsely believe that they
    are invisible or because they took their chances, face harsh
    repercussions from the punishers. People often respond to
    accusations of immorality with displays of shame. This could be a
    useful strategy for avoiding punishment. In this simulation, when
    faced with the threat of punishment, agents have the option of
    “retreating” in shame – not collecting any benefit from the
    group’s cooperation in the next round. This withdrawal would have
    a negative impact on the agents, but the impact would not be as
    great as that of the actual punishment. Punishers would accept
    this act of penance because retaliating against others has a
    negative impact on their health, while accepting the shame of
    others does not.
    
</DIV>



<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>possible future directions: modeling secrecy and shame (cont.)</h1>

  <P>
    Some theories view shame as a result of fear of judgement by
    others (Scheff, 2000). However, some studies have also shown that
    shame has an introspective component, and is experienced even when
    there is no one around to cast judgement (Tangney, 1996). One
    possibility for why this introspective component may have evolved
    is that it could be a preemptive measure – if someone experiences
    shame and its negative effects even when others do not know that
    he has acted immorally, this may deter him from acting immorally
    in the future and facing even harsher punishment.
  </P>
  <P>
    However, it is not clear that this form of shame is beneficial
    from an evolutionary standpoint, since choosing the immoral action
    when no one is watching still seems to be the most successful
    strategy. Thus, the self-directed aspect of shame remains a
    mystery and fertile ground for future research.
  </P>
  <P>
    [Indeed, the follow-up study, described in the next Unit, focuses
    on <B>conscience</B>, which is related to shame.]
