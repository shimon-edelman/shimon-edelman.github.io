    <I>Functional biology.</I> The functional biologist is vitally
    concerned with the operation and interaction of structural
    elements, from molecules up to organs and whole individuals. His

    does it function?

    <I>Evolutionary biology.</I> The evolutionary biologist differs in
    his method and in the problems in which he is interested.  His
    basic question is "Why?"  When we say "why" we must always be
    aware of the ambiguity of this term. It may mean "how come?," but
    it may also mean the finalistic "what for?" It is obvious that the
    evolutionist has in mind the historical "how come?" when he asks
    "why?"

    What is the cause of bird migration? Or more specifically: Why did
    the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warbler"
    target=new>warbler</a> on my summer place in
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hampshire"
    target=new>New Hampshire</a> start his southward migration on the
    night of the 25th of August? 
    <OL>
      <li>
	<I>An ecological cause.</I> The warbler, being an insect
	eater, must migrate, because it would starve to death if it
	should try to winter in New Hampshire.
      </li>
      <li>
	<I>A genetic cause.</I> The warbler has acquired a genetic
	constitution in the course of the evolutionary history of its
	species which induces it to respond appropriately to the
	proper stimuli from the environment. On the other hand, the
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screech_owl"
	target=new>screech owl</a>, nesting right next to it, lacks
	this constitution and does not respond to these stimuli. As a
	result, it is sedentary.
      </li>
      <li>
	<I>An intrinsic physiological cause.</I>  The warbler flew
	south because its migration is tied in with
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circadian_rhythm"
	target=new>photoperiodicity</a>. It responds to the decrease
	in day length and is ready to migrate as soon as the number of
	hours of daylight have dropped below a certain level.
      </li>
      <li>
	<I>An extrinsic physiological cause.</I>  Finally, the warbler
	migrated on the 25th of August because a cold air mass, with
	northerly winds, passed over our area on that day. The sudden
	drop in temperature and the associated weather conditions
	affected the bird, already in a general physiological
	readiness for migration, so that it actually took off on that
	particular day.

    (B) A modern developmental perspective. Red arrows denote additional
    causal influences relative to (A) recognized by fields such as
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_developmental_biology"
    target=new>evo-devo</a> and

    target=new>niche construction</a> theory. During development,
    features of the trait cause changes in both gene expression and
    environment, which feed back to the developmental process,
    resulting in a different trait in the adult and modifications of
    both developmental and selective environments. Development cannot
    be considered purely proximately causal because it results in
    additional causal pathways from the trait in one generation to the
    trait in future generations.

	Cultural evolution: The behavior can be inherited

	Gene-culture coevolution: Genetically and culturally

    "Complex systems cannot be understood as simple extrapolations of
