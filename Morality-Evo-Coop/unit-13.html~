  <h1>a case study in inequality: gender discrimination</h1>

  <P>
    Women and minorities remain underrepresented in the highest ranks
    of
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science,_technology,_engineering,_and_mathematics"
    target=new>STEM</a> fields, politics, business, and other
    high-prestige professions. This underrepresentation at higher
    ranks exists despite more representative demographic distributions
    in early-career stages. Losing the talents of a wide swath of the
    work force incurs tremendous costs both to individual workers’
    earning potential and to institutions’ earnings, innovation, and
    decision-making.
  </P>
  <P class="incremental">
    <font color=red><B>Also: there are costs to persisting in fields in which one represents a
    minority.</B></font>
  </P>

  <P>
    Most <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_theory"
    target=new>interventions</a> designed to remedy
    underrepresentation focus on changing individual factors, such as
    personal attitudes or
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype"
    target=new>stereotypes</a>, or individuals’ interpersonal
    behaviors, such as reducing
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias" target=new><B>bias</B></a>
    in hiring decisions. However, evidence indicates that ‘diversity’
    trainings directed at these factors yield mixed results at
    best. Moreover, they tend to focus on recruitment rather than
    retention.
  </P>

  <P>
    Here we propose that a key contributor to underrepresentation is
    the increased costs associated with being underrepresented in the
    first place. In other
    words, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_discrimination"
    target=new>structural</a> disparities (e.g., a historically
    male-skewed gender ratio) generate conditions under which bias
    will accumulate in greater proportion toward minorities (e.g.,
    women) who are present to receive it. Thus, systemic or structural
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_theory"
    target=new>interventions</a>, though less explored in professional
    settings, hold promise as key to institutional change, e.g.,
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_government#Quotas"
    target=new>quotas</a> in politics.

  <h1>the present work</h1>

  <P>
    Despite the efficacy of structural
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_theory"
    target=new>interventions</a>, there are prohibitive factors that
    leave them less explored; for example, structural interventions
    are logistically challenging, are expected to show effects only
    over long time scales, and carry potential risk of
    “over-correction” or failure. As such, many organizations and
    institutions may consider it too risky to test the effects of
    large-scale structural change. Even for institutions willing to
    implement structural change policies, empirical parameters are
    lacking to estimate over which time horizons different strategies
    for structural change would yield parity (e.g., 1 year, 10 years,
    50 years?).
  </P>

  <P>
    The present work attempts to overcome challenges associated with
    testing the effects of structural disparity, and the long-term
    efficacy of structural and interpersonal change policies. To do
    so, we conduct multi-agent simulations, parameterized by
    empirical evidence from gender and racial bias research, and
    compare the accumulated costs of disparity under different gender
    ratios and
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_theory"
    target=new>intervention</a> strategies.
  </P>

  <P class="incremental">
    Specifically, we compare the long-term efficacy of objection to
    bias (interpersonal) and an equality policy (structural) for
    reducing the costs of gender disparity to individuals and
    institutions.

  <P>
    Agents interact in simulated meetings. In each meeting, one or
    more agents can make sexist comments with varying probabilities
    and, when they do, other agents can object to the occurrence of
    sexism with empirically derived probabilities. Furthermore, in
    each meeting, agents learn from the observation of sexist comments
    and corresponding objections: the probability of sexism either
    increases, when sexism occurs with no objection, or decreases when
    objections follow.  These learning parameters are set based on
    empirical results.
  </P>

  <P>
    Our simulations quantify:
    <ol type=i>
      <li>
	the impact of unequal gender ratios on the count of sexist
	encounters;
      </li>
      <li>
	the associated costs of gender bias to individuals and
	institutions, and
      </li>
      <li>
	the long-term impact of equality policy and bias
	confrontation.
      </li>
    </ol>
  <P>
    We based the multi-agent simulation on the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrie_multiplier"
    target=new>Petrie multiplier</a>, a thought experiment proposed by
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_Petrie"
    target=new>Karen Petrie</a>, and added multi-agent learning from
    observation, objection probabilities, and costs—of receiving
    sexist comments, objecting to sexism, and receiving objections. To
    maximize the relevance of our simulation results to real world
    solutions, all parameters were estimated following our literature
    review of human behavioral data.

  <h1>agent-based simulation</h1>

  <img src="Momennejad19-fig1.png" class="figure-right" height=550>
  <small>
  <ol type=A>
    <li>
      We simulated each institution with 100 agents with different
      gender ratios. For instance, in a 0.2 female institution 80% of
      agents were male and 20% female. The agents were drawn from
      populations with equal probability distributions for
      sexism. That is, if the institution’s ratio was 0.5, the mean
      and standard deviation of their sexism probabilities were equal.
    </li>
    <li>
      In each institution we simulated 1000 meetings (M) with 2-8
      agents randomly drawn from the pool of 100. Each simulation with
      gender ratio and confrontation probabilities was repeated 1000
      times.
    </li>
    <li>
      During each meeting agents interacted. With some probability
      (set based on empirical findings) agents made biased comments,
      leading to a cost of 1 to the target. Agents from the target
      group (e.g., female agents) or allies (e.g., male agents) could
      object. If an objection was made, the perpetrator received a
      cost of 1. Making an objection also incurred a cost of 1 when
      made by a target and a cost of 0.8 when made by an ally.
    </li>
    <li>
      When bias occurred without objection, agents from perpetrator
      group increased their sexism probabilities by 0.1. When bias was
      followed by an objection, the perpetrator group decreased their
      sexism probabilities: by 0.1 if an in-group made the objection,
      and by 0.05 if an agent from the other group (i.e., an ally)
      objected.

    Initial bias probabilities were equal for male and female

    There are three kinds of costs in the present model, inspired by

  <P>
    Here we tested whether enforcing gender parity in an institution
    with a previously skewed gender ratio would eliminate sexism.
    Specifically, after 1000 meetings with a 20/80 ratio we simulated

      We computed sexism probabilities for male and female agents
      after 1000 meetings in a .2 environment, and initialized a new

      environment’s updated probabilities. We simulated 1000, 2000,
      3000, 4000, and 5000 meetings in the new 50/50 environment to
      compare the long-term effects of this equality policy. In spite

    Here we tested whether instituting an equality policy plus
    (increased) objection would eliminate gender differences in the
    receipt of sexist comments. Only when we increased the objection
    probabilities such that 20% more agents from the population — 10%

  <HR>
    <small>
      <P>
	We compared sexist comments per meeting over 1000 simulated
	meetings in four institutions. The <B>first institution</B>
	was initiated with a 50:50 gender ratio and equal
	probabilities of sexism for men and women. Objections were
	allowed. Here the number of sexist comments were equal. The
	<B>second institution</B> was initiated with a .5 ratio but
	carrying over sexism probabilities derived after 1000 meetings

	policy to a previously .2 environment. The <B>third
	institution</B> was the same as the second, but without
	allowing objections by either targets or

	increased the gender gap in the number of sexist comments, but
	this allowed us to isolate the relative efficacy of
	objections. Critically, the <B>fourth institution</B> was
	initiated the same as the second and third, but we increased
	the objection probabilities such that 20% more agents from
	population would object to sexist comments with probability =
	1. In this environment, the gender gap in the number of

  <h1>conclusions</h1>

  <P>
    <BR>
      <ul>
	<li>
	  Simulating institutions with unequal gender ratios (i.e.,
	  female minority environments) led to increased bias towards
	  and costs for the minority group.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Confronting interpersonal gender bias by the target group
	  and allies attenuated, but did not eliminate, the growth of
	  bias and the costs associated with structural bias (i.e.,
	  skewed gender ratios). Notably, institutions with higher
	  gaps in gender ratios suffered more costs.
	</li>
	<li>
	  We also tested the effects of an equality policy, enforcing
	  a 50/50 gender ratio in a previously gender-skewed
	  institution (20/80). After 1000 meetings, we found that the
	  costs to male and female agents were far from equal and this
	  gap widened with more meetings. Thus, enforcing an equal
	  gender ratio alone will not eliminate bias from institutions
	  with a history of structural disparity.  However, increasing
	  the participation of allies in objecting to sexism could.
	</li>
      </ul>
      <P>
	Thus a combination of both structural and interpersonal
	policies for social change appears to be necessary for
	promoting equal treatment of men and women in professional
	settings.
      <P>
	There are many ways in which our simulations represent a ‘best
	case scenario.’ For example, we assumed men and women have
	equal probabilities of displaying bias, and are equally likely
	to confront when they detect bias. Our simulations focused on
	binary groups for simplicity, and did not take into account
	the mediating effects of race and status, or
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersectionality"
	target=new>intersectionality</a>.
      <P>
	Furthermore, in the present model an agent’s parameters only
	change during inter-group interactions. However, in the real
	world unjust gender norms can be learned during single-gender
	interactions (e.g., “locker room” talk where men enforce
	sexist norms, minority “gate keepers” who may impede other
	minorities to remain the exception, women showing gender bias
	against other women, etc.).

</DIV>



<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>limitations and future directions</h1>

  <P>
    <BR>
      In order to simplify this first attempt at modeling bias
      interventions, we restricted our simulations to binary gender
      identities. However, future simulations should implement
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersectionality"
      target=new>intersectionality</a> — assigning multiple social
      group memberships to each agent — in a similar model.
      <P>
	 We also did not allow agents to leave the institutions. In
      the real world, however, individuals drop out of institutions or
      professions due to the accumulating costs of being a
      minority. Findings from twenty corporations in 2008
      <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18211132/"
      target=new>indicated</a> that women and minorities were more
      likely to quit jobs than their majority counterparts. Future
      simulations should incorporate this dropout threshold to account
      for the ”leaky pipeline”, where gender inequality increases at
      the top. In this case, due to increasing accumulated costs the
      longer minorities remain in unbalanced institutions.
