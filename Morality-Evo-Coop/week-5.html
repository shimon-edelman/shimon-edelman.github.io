  <h1>altruistic punishment [Boyd et al. 2003]</h1>

  <P>
    Unlike any other species, humans cooperate with non-kin in large
    groups. This behavior is puzzling from an evolutionary perspective
    because cooperating individuals incur individual costs to confer
    benefits on unrelated group members.
  </P>
  <P>
    Altruistic punishment provides one solution to this puzzle. In
    laboratory experiments, people punish noncooperators at a cost to
    themselves even in one-shot interactions and ethnographic data
    suggest that such altruistic punishment helps to sustain
    cooperation in human societies.
  </P>
  <P>
    But: why do people incur costs to punish others and provide
    benefits to nonrelatives? Here we show that group selection can
    lead to the evolution of altruistic punishment in larger groups
    because the problem of deterring
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-rider_problem"
    target=new>free riders</a> in the case of <B>altruistic
    cooperation</B> is fundamentally different from the problem of
    deterring free riders in the case of <B>altruistic punishment</B>.
  </P>
  <P>
    The difference arises because the payoff disadvantage of
    altruistic cooperators relative to defectors is independent of the
    frequency of defectors in the population; in comparison, the cost
    disadvantage for those engaged in altruistic punishment declines
    as defectors become rare because acts of punishment become very
    infrequent. Thus, when altruistic punishers are common,
    individual-level selection operating against them is weak.
  </P>
  <P>
    In other words, in larger groups, altruistic cooperation may be
    still too costly, whereas <B>altruistic punishment is less and
    less costly, the more it succeeds</B>.
  </P>
  
</DIV>



<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>the key ideas</h1>

  <P>
    Consider a model in which a large population is divided into
    groups of size \(n\). There are two behavioral types, contributors
    and defectors. <B>Contributors</B> incur a cost \(c\) to produce a
    total benefit \(b\) that is shared equally among group members.
    <B>Defectors</B> incur no costs and produce no benefits. If the
    fraction of contributors in the group is \(x\), the expected
    payoff for contributors is \(bx - c\) and the expected payoff for
    defectors is \(bx\), so the payoff disadvantage of the
    contributors is a constant \(c\) independent of the distribution
    of types in the population.
  </P>
  <P>
    Now add a third type, ‘‘<B>punishers</B>’’ who cooperate and then
    punish each defector in their group, reducing each defector’s
    payoff by \(p/n\) at a cost \(k/n\) to the punisher. If the
    frequency of punishers is \(y\), the expected payoffs become \(b(x
    + y) - c\) to contributors, \(b(x + y) - py\) to defectors, and
    \(b(x + y) - c - k(1 - x - y)\) to punishers. Contributors have
    higher fitness than defectors if punishers are sufficiently common
    that the cost of being punished exceeds the cost of cooperating
    \((py > c)\).  Punishers suffer a fitness disadvantage of \(k(1 -
    x - y)\) compared with nonpunishing contributors. Thus, punishment
    is altruistic and mere contributors are ‘‘second-order
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-rider_problem"
    target=new>free riders</a>.’’ Note, however, that the payoff
    disadvantage of punishers relative to contributors approaches zero
    as defectors become rare because there is no need for punishment.
  </P>
  <P>
    The fact that punishers experience only a small disadvantage when
    defectors are rare means that weak within-group evolutionary
    forces, such as mutation or a conformist tendency, can stabilize
    punishment and allow cooperation to persist. But neither produces
    a systematic tendency to evolve toward a cooperative outcome. Here
    we explore the possibility that <I>selection among groups</I>
    leads to the evolution of altruistic punishment when it could not
    maintain altruistic cooperation.
  </P>
  
</DIV>



<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>the model</h1>

  <P>
    <B>Suppose that more cooperative groups are less prone to
    extinction.</B> [Humans always live in social groups in which
    cooperative activities play a crucial role.] Because groups with
    more punishers will tend to exhibit a greater frequency of
    cooperative behaviors (by both contributors and punishers), the
    frequency of punishers and cooperative behaviors will be
    positively correlated across groups. As a result, punishment will
    increase as a ‘‘correlated response’’ to group selection that
    favors more cooperative groups. Because selection within groups
    against punishment is weak when punishment is common, this process
    might support the evolution of substantial levels of punishment
    and maintain punishment once it is common.
  </P>
  <small>
  <P>
    There are \(N\) groups. Local density-dependent competition
    maintains each group at a constant population size
    \(n\). Individuals interact in a two-stage ‘‘game.’’ During the
    first stage, contributors and punishers cooperate with probability
    \(1 - e\) and defect with probability \(e\).  Cooperation reduces
    the payoff of cooperators by an amount \(c\), and increases the
    ability of the group to compete with other groups.
  </P>
  <P>
    For simplicity, we begin by assuming that cooperation has no
    effect on the individual payoffs of others, but does reduce the
    probability of group extinction. Defectors always defect.  During
    the second stage, punishers punish each individual who defected
    during the first stage. After the second stage, individuals
    encounter another individual from their own group with probability
    \(1 - m\) and an individual from another randomly chosen group
    with probability \(m\). <B>An individual \(i\) who encounters an
    individual \(j\) imitates \(j\) with probability \(W_j/(W_j +
    W_i)\), where \(W_x\) is the payoff of individual \(x\) in the
    game, including the costs of any punishment received or
    delivered.</B>
  </P>
  </small>

</DIV>



<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>the model (cont.)</h1>
  
  <P>
    <B>Imitation has two distinct effects: first, it creates a
    selection-like process that causes higher payoff behaviors to
    spread within groups. Second, it creates a migration-like process
    that causes behaviors to diffuse from one group to another at a
    rate proportional to \(m\).</B>
  </P>
  <P>
    Because cooperation has no individual level benefits, defector
    behavior spreads between groups more rapidly than do contributor
    or punisher behaviors.  Group selection occurs through intergroup
    conflict. In each time period, groups are paired at random, and
    with probability \(\epsilon\), intergroup conflict results in one
    group defeating and replacing the other group. The probability
    that group \(i\) defeats group \(j\) is \(\frac{1}{2}(1 + (d_j -
    d_i))\), where \(d_q\) is the frequency of defectors in group
    \(q\). This means that the group with more defectors is more
    likely to lose a conflict. Note that cooperation is the sole
    target of the resulting group selection process; punishment
    increases only to the extent that the frequency of punishers is
    correlated with that of cooperation across groups.
  </P>
  <P>
    Finally, with probability \(\mu\) individuals of each type
    spontaneously switch into one of the two other types. The presence
    of mutation and erroneous defection ensure that punishers will
    incur some punishment costs, even when they are common, thus
    placing them at a disadvantage with respect to the contributors.
  </P>
  
</DIV>



<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>the model: methods</h1>

  <P>
    In all simulations there were 128 groups. Initially one group
    consisted of all altruistic punishers and the other 127 groups
    were all defectors. Simulations were run for \(2,000\) time
    periods. The long run average results plotted in the following
    figures represent the average of frequencies over the last
    \(1,000\) time periods of \(10\) simulations.
  </P>
  <P>
    <B>Base case parameters were chosen to represent cultural
    evolution in small-scale societies.</B> We set the time period to
    be 1 year. Because individually beneficial cultural traits, such
    as technical innovations, diffuse through populations in
    \(10-100\) years, we set the cost of cooperation, \(c\), and
    punishing, \(k\), so that traits with this cost advantage would
    spread in \(50\) time periods \((c = k = 0.2)\).
  </P>
  <P>
    To capture the intuition that in human societies punishment is
    more costly to the punishee than to the punisher we set the cost
    of being punished to four times the cost of punishing \((p =
    0.8)\). We assume that erroneous defection is relatively rare \((e
    = 0.02)\). The migration rate, \(m\), was set so that in the
    absence of any other evolutionary forces, passive diffusion will
    cause two neighboring groups that are initially as different as
    possible to achieve the same trait frequencies in \(\approx 50\)
    time periods \((m = 0.01)\), a value that approximates the
    migration rates in a number of small-scale societies.
  </P>
  <P>
    <small>
    We set the value of the mutation rate so that the long run average
    frequency of an ordinary adaptive trait with payoff advantage
    \(c\) is \(\approx 0.9\) \((\mu = 0.01)\). This means that
    mutation maintains considerable variation, but not so much as to
    overwhelm adaptive forces. We assume that the average group
    extinction rate is consistent with a recent estimate of cultural
    extinction rates in small-scale societies, \(\approx
    0.0075\). Because only one of the two groups entering into a
    conflict becomes extinct this implies that \(\mu = 0.015\).

<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>summary and conclusions [Boyd et al. 2003]</h1>

  <P>
    We have shown that although the logic underlying altruistic
    cooperation and altruistic punishment is similar, their
    evolutionary dynamics are not. In the absence of punishment,
    within-group adaptation acts to decrease the frequency of
    altruistic cooperation, and as a consequence weak drift-like
    forces are insufficient to maintain substantial variation between
    groups. In groups in which altruistic punishers are common,
    defectors are excluded, and this maintains variation in the amount
    of cooperation between groups.  Moreover, in such groups punishers
    bear few costs, and punishers decrease only very slowly in
    competition with contributors. <B>As a result, group selection is
    more effective at maintaining altruistic punishment than
    altruistic cooperation.</B>
  </P>
  <P>
    These results suggest that group selection can play an important
    role in the cultural evolution of cooperative behavior and
    moralistic punishment in humans. The importance of group selection
    is always a quantitative issue. There is no doubt that selection
    among groups acts to favor individually costly, group beneficial
    behaviors. The question is always, is group selection important
    under plausible conditions?
  </P>
  <P>
    With parameter values chosen to represent cultural evolution in
    small-scale societies, cooperation is sustained in groups on the
    order of 100 individuals.  If the ‘‘individuals’’ in the model
    represent family groups (on grounds that they migrate together and
    adopt common practices), altruistic punishment could be sustained
    in groups of 600 people, a size much larger than typical foraging
    bands and about the size of many ethno-linguistic units in
    nonagricultural societies.
  </P>
  
</DIV>



<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>altruistic punishment [Boyd et al. 2010]</h1>

  <P>
    Because mutually beneficial cooperation may unravel unless most
    members of a group contribute, people often gang up on
    free-riders, punishing them when this is cost-effective in
    sustaining cooperation. In contrast, current models of the
    evolution of cooperation assume that punishment is uncoordinated
    and unconditional.
  </P>
  <P>
    These models have difficulty explaining the evolutionary emergence
    of punishment because rare unconditional punishers bear
    substantial costs and hence are eliminated. Moreover, in human
    behavioral experiments in which punishment is uncoordinated, the
    sum of costs to punishers and their targets often exceeds the
    benefits of the increased cooperation that results from the
    punishment of free-riders. As a result, cooperation sustained by
    punishment may actually reduce the average payoffs of group
    members in comparison with groups in which punishment of
    free-riders is not an option.
  </P>
  <P>
    Here, we present a model of coordinated punishment that is
    calibrated for ancestral human conditions and captures a further
    aspect of reality missing from both models and experiments: <B>The
    total cost of punishing a free-rider declines as the number of
    punishers increases. We show that punishment can proliferate when
    rare, and when it does, it enhances group-average payoffs.</B>
  </P>
  
</DIV>



<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>the new model (2010)</h1>

  <P>
    We analyzed a model of the evolution of punishment that
    incorporates two empirically based features absent from previous
    work:
    <ol>
      <li>
	<B>Punishment is coordinated</B> among group members so that it is
	contingent on the number of others predisposed to participate
	in the punishment.  When individuals willing to punish are
	rare, they demur and so bear only the cost of signaling their
	willingness to punish.  They thus avoid the cost of punishing
	when it does not pay.
      </li>
      <li>
	Consistent with the “strength in numbers” and “divide and
	rule” maxims punishment is characterized by <B>increasing returns
	to scale</B>, so the total cost of punishing a single free-rider
	declines as the number of punishers increases.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </P>
  <P>
    Adding these two features resolves the problems with previous
    models. Our model shows that for levels of relatedness consistent
    with recent genetic data from hunter-gather populations,
    punishment can proliferate when rare, and when it is common it
    increases group-average fitness.

    In their classic work on pairwise reciprocity, Axelrod and

    frequencies of the punishing type, and the open circles give
    unstable equilibrium frequencies.

      <li>
	\(b = 4c\). Now for \(0 < \tau \le 3\), <B>rare punishers
	invade a population of nonpunishers, and the only stable
	equilibrium is a mixture of punishers and nonpunishers in
	which cooperation is sustained in most groups.</B> For larger
	thresholds, there are two stable equilibrium frequencies, zero
	and a mixed strategy at which punishers and nonpunishers
	coexist. In these cases, the unstable equilibria (open

  <h1>summary</h1>

  <P>
    Unlike many models of the evolution of punishment, this one does
    not suffer from a “second-order
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-rider_problem"
    target=new>free-rider</a>” problem in which individuals who
    cooperate but do not punish out-compete the punishers.
  </P>
  <P>
    To see why, consider a new strategy: “contingent cooperators,” who
    cooperate during the first period if there are \(\tau + 1\)
    signaling individuals but do not punish. Contingent cooperators
    avoid punishment during the first period and otherwise behave like
    nonpunishers, and thus have higher fitness than nonpunishers. As a
    result, they invade the polymorphic punisher-nonpunisher
    equilibrium, replacing the nonpunishers.  However, because they
    still respond to punishment, and punishment still benefits
    punishers, the population evolves to a stable equilibrium at which
    punishers and contingent cooperators coexist and that cannot be
    invaded by other second-order free-riding types. The frequency of
    punishers at this new equilibrium is approximately the same as in
    the original punisher-nonpunisher equilibrium.

  <h1>the goal: replicating and extending the work of Boyd et al.</h1>

  <P>
    As in the Boyd model, here groups of agents undergo the stages of
    signaling, cooperation, and punishment. Each agent has a running
    count of payoff, which may change at each stage. The groups split
    up every 25 "years", and a new generation of agents replaces the
    previous one and forms new groups. The proportion of punishers and
    non-punishers in each generation is determined by their
    comparative fitness in the previous generation.  The simulation
    has the following parameters:
    <ul>
      <li>
	Initial proportion of punishers in the population.
      </li>
      <li>
	Threshold proportion of punishers needed for punishment to
	occur.
      </li>
      <li>
	Benefit from cooperation (ratio of value obtained from a
	cooperative act to cost to cooperating agents).
      </li>
      <li>
	Cost to defecting agents.

    <P>
      If threshold proportion is too high compared to initial
      proportion of punishers, no groups or very few groups reach the
      threshold, so punishers are unable to retaliate against
      defectors, and therefore have no use. The proportion of

    <P>
      Previously, Boyd et al. found that the final proportion of
      punishers reached once the simulation was in its steady state
      depended on the threshold proportion needed for punishment to
      occur.
    </P>
    <P>
      Likewise, in this version of the simulation, a higher threshold
      proportion resulted in a higher final proportion of
      punishers. The final proportion tended to be slightly higher
      than the threshold proportion.

  <P>
    In Boyd's version of the simulation, an agents’ choice to
    cooperate or defect was influenced only by whether or not
    defecting agents were punished in the previous round. The extent
    of the punishment did not influence the decision.
  </P>
  <P>
    I [Smirnova] replicated this in my version of the simulation,
    leading to a counterintuitive result: a higher cost to defectors
    did not lead to a higher proportion of punishers in the
    population; rather, it led to a lower one.

  <h1>possible future directions: improving the mechanics of the model</h1>

  <P>
    The current implementation of reproduction in the model determines
    the proportion of punishers and non-punishers in the next
    generation based on the respective success of these groups in the
    previous generation. This method of modeling reproduction was
    chosen because it gives smoother and more consistent results than
    modeling reproduction on an individual basis. Moreover, agents can
    only reproduce at the end of each generational cycle. The
    simulation could potentially be improved by modeling reproduction
    more realistically. For instance, an agent could be required to
    have fitness above a certain threshold in order to produce
    offspring. Reproducing would cause the agent’s fitness to
    decrease, and it could not reproduce again until its fitness
    increased to the required level again.
  </P>
  <P>
    Boyd's version of the simulation modeled the decision of whether
    to defect or cooperate as independent of the cost to the
    defectors. Thus, incurring a higher cost to defectors actually
    harmed punishers more than non-punishers. Choosing to model the
    probability of defecting as a function of cost to defectors would
    allow varying this parameter to have meaningful results on the
    outcome of the simulation.

  <h1>possible future directions: modeling secrecy and shame</h1>

  <P>
    What role do secrecy and <B>shame</B> play in morality? One way to
    address this question may be this: at randomly chosen times,
    certain agents become “invisible” [compare this to the mythical
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_of_Gyges"
    target=new>Ring of Gyges</a>], so that potential punishers cannot
    catch them in the act. Invisible agents are aware that they cannot
    be seen – however, because we do not always know when someone may
    be watching, there is a small chance that they may be mistaken and
    believe that they are invisible when, in reality, they are
    not. The way an agent behaves when invisible (in other words, the
    chance of cooperation vs. defection) would be a heritable trait,
    because the model intends to show how agents can evolve to take
    advantage of the ability to hide from society.
  </P>
  <P>
    Agents who defect, either because they falsely believe that they
    are invisible or because they took their chances, face harsh
    repercussions from the punishers. People often respond to
    accusations of immorality with displays of shame. This could be a
    useful strategy for avoiding punishment. In this simulation, when
    faced with the threat of punishment, agents have the option of
    “retreating” in shame – not collecting any benefit from the
    group’s cooperation in the next round. This withdrawal would have
    a negative impact on the agents, but the impact would not be as
    great as that of the actual punishment. Punishers would accept
    this act of penance because retaliating against others has a
    negative impact on their health, while accepting the shame of
    others does not.
    
</DIV>



<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>possible future directions: modeling secrecy and shame (cont.)</h1>

  <P>
    Some theories view shame as a result of fear of judgement by
    others (Scheff, 2000). However, some studies have also shown that
    shame has an introspective component, and is experienced even when
    there is no one around to cast judgement (Tangney, 1996). One
    possibility for why this introspective component may have evolved
    is that it could be a preemptive measure – if someone experiences
    shame and its negative effects even when others do not know that
    he has acted immorally, this may deter him from acting immorally
    in the future and facing even harsher punishment.
  </P>
  <P>
    However, it is not clear that this form of shame is beneficial
    from an evolutionary standpoint, since choosing the immoral action
    when no one is watching still seems to be the most successful
    strategy. Thus, the self-directed aspect of shame remains a
    mystery and fertile ground for future research.
  </P>
  <P>
    [Indeed, the follow-up study, described next week, focuses
    on <B>conscience</B>, which is related to shame.]
