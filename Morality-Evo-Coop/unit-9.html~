  <h1>learning social norms</h1>

  <P>
    <ul>
      <li>
	<I>Learning to be thoughtless: social norms and individual competition</I> [Epstein, 2001].
      </li>
    </ul>
  </P>
  <P>
    This work studies "a phenomenon that has been essentially ignored,
    namely that individual thought – or computing – is often inversely
    related to the strength of a social norm. Once a norm is
    entrenched, we conform thoughtlessly. In this model, agents learn
    how to behave (what norm to adopt), but – under a strategy I term
    Best Reply to Adaptive Sample Evidence – they also learn how much
    to think about how to behave. How much they are thinking affects
    how they behave, which – given how others behave – affects how
    much they think. In short, there is feedback between the social
    (interagent) and internal (intra-agent) dynamics. In addition, we
    generate the stylized facts regarding the spatio-temporal
    evolution of norms: local conformity, global diversity, and
    punctuated equilibria."
  </P>
	
</DIV>



<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>motivation</h1>

  <P>
    "When I’d had my coffee this morning and went upstairs to get
    dressed for work, I never considered being a nudist for the
    day. When I got in my car to drive to work, it never crossed my
    mind to drive on the left. And when I joined my colleagues at
    lunch, I did not consider eating my salad barehanded; without a
    thought, I used a fork."
  </P>
  <P>
    The point is that many social conventions have two features
    of interest:
    <ul>
      <li>
	First, they are self-enforcing behavioral
	regularities.
      </li>
      <li>
	But second, once entrenched, we conform without
	thinking about it.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </P>
  <P>
    Indeed, this is one reason why social norms are useful; they
    obviate the need for a lot of individual computing. After all, if
    we had to go out and sample people on the street to see if nudism
    or dress were the norm, and then had to sample other drivers to
    see if left or right were the norm, and so on, we would spent most
    of the day figuring out how to operate, and we would not get much
    accomplished.
  </P>
  <P>
    Thoughtless conformity, while useful in such contexts, is
    frightening in others – as when norms of discrimination become
    entrenched. The literature on the evolution of norms and
    conventions has focused almost exclusively on the first feature of
    norms – that they are self-enforcing behavioral regularities.
  </P>
  
</DIV>



<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>an agent-based computational model</h1>

  <P>
    This model posits a ring of interacting agents. Each agent
    occupies a fixed position on the ring and has two attributes:
    <ol>
      <li>
	A binary ‘norm’ (as in ‘drive on the right (R) vs. drive on
	the left (L)’). Initially, agents are assigned norms.
      </li>
      <li>
	A sampling radius.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </P>
  <P>
    Agents update their norms based on observation of agents within
    their sampling radius, which is heterogeneous across agents.  It
    is updated, or ‘adapted’, incrementally according to a simple
    rule.
  </P>
  <P>
    <B>Radius Update Rule.</B>  Imagine being an agent with current
    sampling radius of \(r\).
    <ul>
      <li>
	First, survey all \(r\) agents to the left and all \(r\)
	agents to the right. Some have \(L\) as their norm and some
	have \(R\).
      </li>
      <li>
	Let \(F(r)\) be the relative frequency of \(R\)s at radius
	\(r\). Now, make the same computation for radius \(r + 1\).
      </li>
      <li>
	If \(F(r + 1) \neq F(r)\), then increase your search radius to
	\(r + 1\); otherwise, compute \(F(r-1)\).
      </li>
      <li>
	If \(F(r-1) = F(r)\), then reduce your search radius to
	\(r-1\).
      </li>
      <li>
	If neither condition obtains (i.e., if \(F(r +1) = F(r) \neq
	F(r −1))\), leave your search radius unchanged at \(r\).
      </li>
    </ul>
  </P>
  <P>
    <small>
      Agents are ‘lazy statisticians’. If they are getting a different
      result at a higher radius \((F(r+1) \neq F(r))\), they increase
      the radius (because larger-sample statistics are more
      reliable). But they are also lazy: if there’s no difference at
      the higher radius, they check a lower one.  If there is no
      difference between that and their current radius \((F(r-1) =
      F(r))\), they reduce the radius.
    </small>
  </P>
    
</DIV>


<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>norm update rule</h1>

  <P>
    The <B>Norm Update Rule</B> is extremely simple:
    <DIR><DIR> Match the majority within your radius.
    </DIR></DIR>
  </P>
  <P>
    If, at the updated radius, Ls outnumber Rs, then adopt the L
    norm. In summary, the rule is: <I>When in Rome, do as the
    (majority of) Romans do, with the (adaptive) radius determining
    the ‘city limits’.</I> 
  </P>
  <P>
    This rule is equivalent to <I>Best Reply to Sample Evidence</I> with a
    symmetric payoff matrix:
    <div align=center>
    <table>
      <tr>
	<td></td><td align=center>L</td><td align=center>R</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td>L</td><td>(1,1)</td><td>(0,0)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td>R</td><td>(0,0)</td><td>(1,1)</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    </div>
  </P>
  <P>
    The rule maximizes the expected utility (sum of payoffs) in
    playing the agent’s sample population. The key point introduced
    here is that each individual’s sample size is itself
    adaptive. This is why the individual’s combined (norm and search
    radius) updating procedure can be called <I>Best Reply to Adaptive
    Sample Evidence.</I>
  </P>
  <P>
    Finally, there is generally some probability that an agent will
    adopt a random L or R ("noise").
  </P>

</DIV>


<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>the graphics</h1>

  <P>
    With this set-up, there are two things to keep track of: the
    evolution of social norm patterns on the agent ring, and the
    evolution of individual search radii.
  </P>
  <P>
    In the runs shown below, there are 191 agents. They are drawn at
    random and updated asynchronously.  Clearly, each agent’s
    probability of being drawn k times per cycle (191 draws with
    replacement) has the Binomial distribution \(b(k; n, 1/n)\), with
    \(n = 191\).  Agents who are not drawn keep their previous
    norm. After 191 draws – one cycle – the new ring is redrawn below
    the old one (as a horizontal series of small contiguous black and
    white dots), so time is progressing down the page.
  </P>
  <P>
    There are two Panels. The left Panel shows the evolution of norms,
    with L-agents colored black and R-agents colored white. With the
    exception of Run 4, each entire Panel displays 300 cycles (each
    cycle, again, being a sequence of 191 random calls.)  The right
    window shows the evolution of search radii, using
    grayscale. Agents are colored black if \(r = 1\), with
    progressively higher radii depicted as progressively lighter
    shades of gray.
  </P>

</DIV>


<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>monolithic social norm, individual computing dies out</h1>

  <img src="Epstein01-fig1.png" class="figure-right" height=450>
  <P>
    For this first run, we set all agents to the L norm (coloring them
    black) initially and set noise to zero. Each agent has a random
    initial search radius between 1 and 60 (artificially high to show
    the strength of the result in the monolithic case).
  </P>
  <P>
    <I>Right panel.</I> The uppermost line (the initial population
    state) (191 agents across) is multi-shaded, reflecting the random
    initial radii. Let us now apply the radial update rule to an
    arbitrary agent with radius r.  First look out further. We find
    that \(F(r + 1) = F(r)\), because all agents are in the L norm
    (black). Now, try a smaller radius. Because \(F(r−1) = F(r)\), the
    agent reduces from \(r\) to \(r - 1\).
  </P>
  <P>
    <I>Left panel.</I> Now, apply the norm update rule. At this new
    radius, match the majority. Clearly, this is L (black), so stay
    L. This is the same logic for all agents. Thus, the social norm
    remains entrenched, and, as shown in the right panel, individual
    ‘thinking’ dies out – radii all shrink to the minimum of 1
    (colored black).
  </P>

</DIV>


<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>random initial norms, individual computing at norm boundaries</h1>

  <img src="Epstein01-fig2.png" class="figure-right" height=450>
  <P>
    With noise still at zero, we now alter the initial conditions
    slightly. In this, and all subsequent runs, the initial maximum
    search radius is 10. Rather than set all agents in the L norm
    initially, we give them random norms. The typical result is shown
    here. 
  </P>
  <P>
    <I>Left panel.</I> There is rapid lock-in to a global pattern of
    alternating local norms on the ring.
  </P>
  <P>
    <I>Right panel.</I> Deep in each local norm, agents are colored
    black: there is no individual computing (no ‘thinking’). In
    contrast, agents at the boundary of two norms must worry about how
    to behave, and so are bright-shaded.
  </P>

</DIV>


<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>complacency in new norms</h1>

  <img src="Epstein01-fig3.png" class="figure-right" height=450>
  <P>
    In the 1960’s, people smoked in airplanes, restaurants, and
    workplaces, and no one gave it much thought. Today, it is equally
    entrenched that smoking is prohibited in these circumstances.
    After the ‘revolution’ entirely new norms prevail, but once
    entrenched, people become inured to them; they are observed every
    bit as thoughtlessly (in our sense) as before.
  </P>
  <P>
    This run begins as before, with randomly distributed initial norms
    and zero noise. The system reaches equilibrium, locking into
    neighborhood norms (as before, these appear as vertical stripes
    over time). Then, at t = 130, we shock the system, boosting the
    level of noise to 1.0, and holding it there for ten periods. Then
    we turn the noise off and watch the system re-equilibrate.
  </P>
  <P>
    After the shock, an entirely new pattern of norms is evident on
    the left. But, looking at the right (radius) panel, we see that
    many agents who were thoughtlessly in the L norm (black) before
    the shock are equally thoughtlessly in the R norm (white) after.
  </P>

</DIV>


<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>time series plot</h1>

  <img src="Epstein01-fig4.png" class="figure-right" height=450>
  <P>
    A time series plot of average radius over the course of this
    experiment is also revealing. Following an initial transient
    phase, the mean radius attains a steady state value of roughly
    2.25. During the brief ‘shock’ period of maximum noise, the
    average radius rises sharply, reflecting the agents’ search for
    appropriate behavior in a period of social turmoil.
  </P>
  <P>
    One might expect that, with noise restored to zero, the average
    radius would relax back to its pre-shock value.  In fact, the
    post-shock steady state depends on the postshock number of local
    norms. The lower the diversity, the lower the number of borders
    and, as in the present run, the lower the average radius.
  </P>

</DIV>


<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>noise of 0.15 and endogenous neighborhood norms</h1>

  <img src="Epstein01-fig5.png" class="figure-right" height=450>
  <P>
    Now, noise levels of zero and one are not especially plausible.
    The next four runs use the same initial conditions as Run 2, but
    add increasing levels of noise.  With noise set at 0.15, we obtain
    dynamics of the sort shown here.  Again, we see that individual
    computing is most intense at the norm borders – regions outlining
    the norms. We also see the emergence and disappearance of norms,
    the most prominent of which is the white island that comes into
    being and then disappears. One can think of islands as indicating
    punctuated equilibria.
  </P>

</DIV>


<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>time series for noise of 0.15</h1>

  <img src="Epstein01-fig6.png" class="figure-right" height=450>
  <P>
    Following an initial transient phase, the average search radius
    clearly settles at roughly 2.0 for this realization.5 Even at zero
    cost of sampling, in other words, a ‘stopping rule’ for the
    individual search radius emerges endogenously through local agent
    interactions. And this obtains at all levels of noise.
  </P>

</DIV>


<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>maximum noise</h1>

  <img src="Epstein01-fig11.png" class="figure-right" height=350>
  <P>
    Finally, we fix the noise level at its maximum value of 1.0,
    meaning that agents are adopting the Left and Right convention
    totally at random. One might assume that, in this world of maximum
    randomness, agents would continue to expand their search to its
    theoretical maximum of \((n - 1)/2\), or 95 in this case. But this
    is not what happens.
  </P>
  <img src="Epstein01-fig12.png" class="figure-right" height=300>
    <P>
      Indeed, as the time series plot shows, it rises only to about
      4.5 (the 95% confidence interval is [4.53, 4.63]).  Thinking –
      individual computing – is minimized in the monolithic world of
      Run 1.  But, it does not attain its theoretical maximum in the
      totally random world of this run.
    </P>
    <HR>
    <P>
      Bottom line:
      <blockquote>
	Individual computing is often inversely related to the strength of a social
	norm. As norms become entrenched, we conform thoughtlessly.
      </blockquote>
    </P>
