  <P>
    <I>[from the syllabus]</I><BR>
    Morality that values cooperation is a universal characteristic of
    human societies, as demonstrated by anthropological studies and
    analyses of ethnographic records from all over the world. Our
    readiness to cooperate (along with the sophistication we bring to
    the table, made possible by the use of language) has propelled our
    species to planetary dominance. In this seminar, we shall take up
    some of the central questions arising in connection with the
    evolutionary origins, the psychological underpinnings, and the
    social dynamics of human cooperation.
  </P>
  <P>
    The central insight that unifies the explanations of cooperation
    offered by the relevant disciplines is that <B>human cooperation
    is conditional</B>. This idea is best explored
    using
    <a href="http://milesberry.net/2016/11/computational-thinking-and-mathematical-reasoning/"
    target=new><I>computational</I></a> methods in social
    sciences. While evolutionary science, social psychology, and
    sociology are of key importance to the understanding of the world
    we live in, the complexity of the processes they study presents a
    challenge to the traditional scientific method, which tries to
    derive
    <a href="http://milesberry.net/2016/11/computational-thinking-and-mathematical-reasoning/"
    target=new><I>mathematical</I></a> models from experimental
    data. This is why in these disciplines, scientists often resort to
    simulation, using an agent-based modeling (ABM) approach.
  </P>
  <HR>
    <P>
      <small>
	In evolutionary ABM, simulated actors (agents) carrying
	various traits of interest share an environment in which they
	undertake actions and compete for resources. The agent’s
	cumulative outcomes determine its fitness, which in turn
	affects its chances for reproduction. The effectiveness of
	traits can then be assessed by tracking their prevalence in
	the population over evolutionary time. Similarly, in
	computational social science, the ABM approach involves
	simulated agents with controlled cognitive abilities,
	“personalities,” and interpersonal attitudes. The social
	dynamics that arises out of the agents’ interactions is then
	analyzed and used to support theory development.

    </li>
  </ul>
  <P>
    "When generalized, the various statements of the logical gulf
    between the moral judgment and the scientific reduces itself to an
    assertion of two antinomies: one, the separation between the
    universal and the individual; the other, between the intellectual
    and the practical. And these two antinomies finally reduce
    themselves to one: Scientific statements refer to <I>generic
    conditions</I> and relations, which are therefore capable of
    complete and objective statement; ethical judgments refer to
    an <I>individual act</I> which by its very nature transcends
    objective statement."
  </P>
  <P class="incremental">
    "There is no road open from any generic formula to an individual
    judgment. The road leads through the habits and mental attitudes
    of the one concerned in judging. The universal gets logical force,
    as well as psychical reality, only in the acts by which it is
    invented and constructed as a tool and then is employed for the
    purpose for which it was intended."
  </P>
  <P class="incremental">
    "It is no paradox to say that the activity of the agent in the act
    of judging expresses itself in effort to prevent its activity from
    having any influence upon the material judged. Accordingly through
    such judgments 'external' objects are determined, the activity of
    the judger being kept absolutely neutral or indifferent as to its
    reference."
  </P>

<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>Dewey (1903) on the science of morality (cont.)</h1>

  <P>
    "The aim of the ethical judgment may be stated as follows: Its
    purpose is to construct the act of judgment as itself a complex
    objective content. It goes back of the judging act as that is
    employed in distinctively intellectual processes, and makes its
    quality and nature (as distinct from its form — a question for
    psychology) an object of consideration. Just because character or
    disposition is involved in the material passed in review and
    organized in judgment, character is determined by the
    judgment. This is a fact of tremendous ethical significance; but
    here its import is not ethical, but logical. It shows that we are
    dealing, from the strictly logical point of view, with a
    characteristic type of judgment — that in which the conditions of
    judging activity are themselves to be objectively determined. The
    judger is engaged in judging himself; and thereby in so far is
    fixing the conditions of all further judgments of any type
    whatsoever."
  </P>
  <P class="incremental">
    "Put in more psychological terms, we may say the judgment
    realizes, through conscious deliberation and choice, a certain
    motive hitherto more or less vague and impulsive; or it expresses
    a habit in such a way as not merely to strengthen it practically,
    but as to bring to consciousness both its emotional worth and its
    significance in terms of certain kinds of consequences. But from
    the logical standpoint we say that the judger is consciously
    engaged in constructing as an object (and thereby giving objective
    form and reality to) the controlling condition of every exercise
    of judgment."

  <P>
    "Theorists have been attempting to tell what the ideal of man is,
    what is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summum_bonum"
    target=new><I>summum bonum</I></a>, what is man's duty, what are
    his responsibilities, to prove that he is possessed or not
    possessed of freedom, without any regulated way of defining the
    content of the terms "ideal," "good," "duty," etc. If these terms
    have any verifiable proper meaning of their own, it is as limiting
    traits of that type of judgment which institutes the reciprocal
    identification of psychical attitude in judging and subject-matter
    judged."
  </P>
  <P class="incremental">
    "Every statement of moral theory which purports to relate to our
    moral consciousness sees forth relations whose truth must
    ultimately be tested through psychological analysis — just as
    every judgment regarding a specific physical phenomenon must
    finally satisfy certain generic conditions of physical reality set
    forth in physical analysis."
  </P>
  <P class="incremental">
    "To discuss what it is to have an ideal is to engage in
    psychological analysis. If the having-an-ideal can be stated in
    terms of sequence with other similar attitudes, then we have a
    psychological generic statement (or law) which can be employed as
    a tool of analysis in reflecting upon concrete moral experiences,
    just as the "law" of falling bodies is of use in controlling our
    judgment of piledrivers, the trajectory of shells, etc. The
    possibility of <I>generalized propositions</I> regarding any
    character phenomenon stands and falls with the possibility of
    psychological analysis revealing regular association or
    co-ordination of certain tendencies, habits, or dispositions with
    one another. Hence the continued reiteration that psychology as a
    natural science deals only with facts, while ethics is concerned
    with values, norms, ideals which
    <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/metaethics/#IsOOpeQueArg"
    target=new><I><B>ought</B></I></a> to be whether they exist or no,
    is either aside from the point, or else proves the impossibility
    of making any general statements, metaphysical as well as
    practical and scientific, about such matters."
  </P>
  <P class="incremental">
    "It is assumed that the situation which calls forth distinctively
    moral judgment is a social situation, which accordingly can be
    adequately described only through methods of sociological
    analysis."

  <P>
    "Cooperation is a fundamental aspect of human behavior but is
    evolutionarily rare and difficult to explain. The benefits
    expected to come through cooperation are susceptible to the
    free-rider problem — individuals who do not engage in the costly
    cooperative behavior may still benefit from cooperative actions of
    others. As such, over half a century of work has gone into
    explaining the existence of cooperation using mathematical and
    computational models from evolutionary biology."
  </P>
  <P class="incremental">
    "COOPERATION is defined as any behavior that is costly to the
    actor and beneficial to the recipient. <font color=gray>This
    definition may include some processes not typically thought of as
    cooperation, such as coercion, but the dynamics underlying the
    processes may have the same evolutionary outcomes so they may be
    thought of within the same framework.</font> EVOLUTION is defined
    as the change in frequency of anything that can be inherited by an
    individual from other individuals. <font color=gray>This includes
    genetic evolution but also includes cultural and epigenetic
    evolution.</font>"

    "Evolution of cooperation is a key area where evolutionary
    anthropologists can contribute methodologically, theoretically,
    and empirically to evolutionary biology. [...] Because our model
    organism—ourselves—can speak directly to us, learning about those
    mechanisms may be easier.
    <BR>
      <small>For instance, two competing mechanisms that may underlie
	indirect reciprocity models of the evolution of cooperation
	are gossip and costly signaling.  These were originally
	considered because of ethnographic investigation. Subsequent
	research has found support for costly signaling, the high cost
	of being altruistic makes it an honest signal of future
	cooperation, and this has become a key mechanistic model
	underlying the study of the evolution of cooperation in both
	evolutionary anthropology and behavioral ecology.</small>"

  <P>
    "An <I>internal norm</I> is a pattern of behavior enforced in part
    by internal sanctions, such as shame, guilt and loss of
    self-esteem, as opposed to purely external sanctions, such as
    material rewards and punishment. The ability to internalize norms
    is widespread among humans, although in some so-called
    ‘‘sociopaths’’, this capacity is diminished or lacking. Suppose
    there is one genetic locus that controls the capacity to
    internalize norms. This model shows that if an internal norm is
    fitness enhancing, then for plausible patterns of socialization,
    the allele for internalization of norms is evolutionarily
    stable. This framework can be used to model Herbert Simon’s (1990)
    explanation of altruism, showing that altruistic norms can
    ‘‘hitchhike’’ on the general tendency of internal norms to be
    personally fitness-enhancing. A multi-level selection,
    gene-culture coevolution argument then explains why individually
    fitness-reducing internal norms are likely to be prosocial as
    opposed to socially harmful."
