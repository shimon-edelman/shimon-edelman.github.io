      its commencement (top panel) and conclusion (bottom

      <P>
	<small>
	  Do people live in homogenous neighborhoods because they are
	  racist? Schelling (1971) challenged this assumption, asking
	  whether segregated neighborhoods would form even when
	  individuals had no prejudice, and only wanted a few
	  neighbors similar to themselves.  Schelling placed red and
	  green pennies on a chessboard to represent people in
	  neighborhoods. People were happy—and remained in their
	  square—if they were surrounded by at least 30% of their
	  “color”; if this number dropped below 30%, however, people
	  became unhappy and moved to a new square.  Schelling played
	  out this model by moving pennies one by one until each
	  person on the board was happy, by which time the board was
	  highly color segregated.

  <h1>why ABMs</h1>

  <P>
    Agent-Based Models (ABMs) ... build social structures from the
    ‘bottom-up’, by simulating individuals by virtual agents, and

    target=new><B>emergent</B></a> organizations out of the operation of

  </P>
  <P>
    ABMs have several attractive features that supplement
    traditional methods for exploring group behavior.
    <ol>
      <li>
	They are expressed with unambiguous mathematical and
	computational formalisms so that once they have been fully
	described, their predictions are clear, quantitative and
	objective.
      </li>
      <li>
	They provide true bridging explanations that link two distinct
	levels of analysis: the properties of individual agents
	(e.g. their attributes and interactions), and the emergent
	group-level behavior.  When successful, agent-based models are
	particularly satisfying models because they show how coherent,
	group-level structures can spontaneously emerge without
	leaders ordering the organization, and sometimes despite
	leaders’ effort.
      </li>
      <li>
	Because the models are typically either simple or informed by
	real-world data, they are appropriately constrained and cannot
	[indiscriminately] fit any conceivable pattern of data. The
	    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-organization"

      <I>Computational description at the level of agents.</I>
      <BR>
	ABMs consists of a large number of interacting agents,

	than global information. High-level summary descriptions
	emerge from the unfolding agent interactions but they are not

	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stigmergy"
	   target=new>Stigmergy</a> is a form of indirect
	communication between agents that is achieved by agents

  <h1>idealized vs. detailed models</h1>

  <P>
    The most fundamental decision an ABM researcher makes is how
    detailed their model will be. Many researchers purposefully choose
    to create highly idealized models that boil down a collective
    phenomenon to its functional essence. Researchers pursuing
    idealized models are typically motivated to describe
    domain-general mechanisms with a wide sphere of application.
  </P>
  <P>
    A good example of this strategy is
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Axelrod"
       target=new>Robert Axelrod</a>’s Culture Model. The goal of this
       model is to explain how beliefs or attitudes converge or
       diverge in a population over time. Agents are placed at fixed
       locations within a 2D grid, and initially have random trait
       values on each of several features. The likelihood of
       neighboring agents interacting with one another is proportional
       to their similarity across all features. When two agents
       interact, one of the trait values of one of the agents is
       copied to the other agent, in a process that simulates cultural
    imitation or social influence.
  </P>
  <P>
    Over time, spatial clusters of like-minded agents develop,
    although some diversity of opinion is often maintained as
    dissimilar agents are unlikely to interact even if they are
    neighbors (see next slide). This simple model can explain (i) the
    spatial clustering of opinions, (ii)
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwagon_effect"
    target=new>bandwagon effects</a>, and (iii) the spontaneous
    division of a culture into sub-cultures.

  <h1>example of an idealized model: culture clustering</h1>

  <img src="Goldstone05-fig1.png" class="figure-right" height=500>
  <P>
    Four simulations of Axelrod’s Culture Model. Each agent is
    represented by a color that represents their entire set of
    features (e.g. hobby) and trait values (e.g. chess, badminton,
    violin). Agents with identical colors have identical traits. 
    <ol type=a>
      <li>
	An initial, randomly generated population of agents, each
	possessing two traits (TZ2) on each of two features (FZ2). 
      </li>
      <li>
	The same population after 4000 generations of interactions in
	which neighboring agents copy each others’ traits, with the
	probability of interaction proportional to the agents’
	similarity. The population is frozen because the red and green
	agents have no traits in common and hence will never interact.
      </li>
      <li>
	After 4000 generations, a simulation starting with agents
	characterized by two trait values (TZ2) along 15 features
	(FZ15). Increasing the number of features increases the
	probability of a homogeneous, like-minded population
	emerging. 
      </li>
      <li>
	When FZ3 and TZ15, the population quickly becomes frozen into
	small cliques that have no crossgroup interactions. Increasing
	the number of traits per feature decreases the size of
	cliques.

    Other ABMs are intimately tied to a specific domain because they
    include a considerable amount of detail derived from real world
    datasets and their goal is answering a specific real-world
    question. One such question is, ‘Why did the

    abandon their homeland around 1350 AD?’

  <P>
    The ABM here incorporates features grounded in historical records:
     maize production levels, ground water reserves, the 3D geography
     of the Anasazi’s Long House Valley homeland, populations
     established from archeological digs, and social trends regarding
     childbirth age, the average age of children leaving home, and
     food consumption needs, all based upon recent maize-growing

  <h1>ABMs (computational) vs. descriptive (mathematical) models</h1>

  <P>
    To create tractable descriptive equations it is often necessary to
    make misleading assumptions that fail to capture essential aspects
    of natural phenomena. One example is the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_field_theory"
	 target=new>Mean Field Approximation</a>, according to which all
      individuals in a group are assumed to be in the same location
      and experience the same local environment.
  </P>
  <P>
    ABMs that incorporate space and local variability frequently
    produce much more realistic models. For example, giving agents
    unique rather than aggregate positions has proven invaluable in
    modeling the continued stability of host-pathogen populations, the
    genetic diversity in a population, and preserved pockets of
    cooperation surrounded by defectors.
  </P>
  <P>
    More generally, ABMs often provide more satisfying accounts
    than purely descriptive approaches because they posit <B>mechanisms</B>
    by which aggregate qualities emerge.

  <h1>three core themes for agent-based models</h1>

  <P>
    Three prevalent themes for computational models of
    collective behavior:
  </P>
  <P>
    <I>Patterns and organization.</I>  Human trails, traffic jams,
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_(audience)"
       target=new>Mexican waves</a>, and panic behavior of
    pedestrians. In these models humans are represented as
    particles with variation in speeds or position, and without
    any requirement of cognition for the agents. These simple
	reactive agent-based simulation models have often provided
    surprisingly apt accounts of empirically observed behavior.
  </P>
  <P>
    <I>Contagion.</I> Social contagion is the spread of an entity or
    influence between individuals in a population via interactions
    between agents. Examples are the spreading of fads, rumors and
    riots. Computational approaches to simulate social contagion are
    based on thresholds models. Each agent has a threshold that, when
    exceeded, leads the agent to adopt an activity.
  </P>
  <P>
    <I>Cooperation.</I>  A social dilemma is a situation where
    sub-optimal group outcomes are achieved if all agents do the
    action that is optimal for themselves. If self-centered rational
    agents do not cooperate in social dilemmas why do we often find
    cooperation in actual case studies? The work of Axelrod on the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma"
       target=new>Prisoner&rsquo;s Dilemma</a> led to a large
       literature on extensions of the original models to include the
       addition of space, indirect reciprocity, and more complex
       strategies. Most of this work uses simple reactive agents. Some
       recent studies focus on more cognitively sophisticated agents
       with designs informed by psychological theories, such as
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_comparison_theory"
       target=new>social comparison</a> and
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounded_rationality"

    target=new>Covid-19</a> if policies are implemented to affect
    social contacts of potential carriers?’ and ‘What would be the
    impact on world demographics if parents can choose the sex of

    realistic, they will serve as increasingly useful test-beds for
    exploring potential consequences of public policies that have

    <I>Group control through indirect manipulation rather than
      explicit rules.</I> Perhaps the most common method of crowd
      control is through direct orders or laws. If we wish to direct
      pedestrian traffic, for example, we may institute rules or
      physical barriers that prohibit certain movements. The cost of
      such prohibitions is decreased pedestrian morale and the
      perception of excluded possibilities. ABMs suggest an
      alternative method of crowd control by changing the structure of
      the environment such that certain behaviors are facilitated and
      others are indirectly hindered without instituting physical or
      abstract barriers.

  <h1>ABMs and sociology</h1>

  <P>
    Agent-based models (ABMs) of human social interaction are based on

    target=new>hierarchical</a> system of institutions and norms that
    shape individual behavior from the top down. Interest in ABMs
    reflects growing interest in the possibility that human groups,
    like flocks of birds, may be highly complex, nonlinear,

    target=new>path-dependent</a>, and
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-organization"

  <h1>ABM simulation in sociology</h1>

  <P>
    The third wave in social simulation, agent-based modeling,
    coincided with the advent of the personal computer in the
    1980s. Like microsimulation, these bottom-up models explored the
    microfoundations of global patterns. The difference is that,
    unlike the socially isolated actors in microanalytical simulation,
    the agents now interact interdependently.
  </P>
  <P>
    ABMs impose four key assumptions:
    <ol>
      <li>
	<I>Agents are autonomous.</I>  Systemic patterns <B>emerge</B>
	from the bottom up, coordinated not by centralized authorities
	or institutions (although these may exist as environmental
	constraints) but by local interactions among autonomous
	decision-makers.  This process is known as
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-organization"
	   target=new>"self-organization"</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
	<I>Agents are interdependent.</I> Interdependence may involve
	processes like persuasion, sanctioning, and imitation, in
	which agents influence others in response to the influence
	that they receive. Interdependence may also be indirect, as
	when agents&rsquo; behaviors change some aspect of the
	environment, which in turn affects the behavior of other
	agents, such that the consequences of each agent&rsquo;s
	decisions depend in part on the choices of others.

      <li>
	Latane’s (1996) Social Impact Model.
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    Uses a rule to mimic one’s neighbors in a two-dimensional
	    lattice.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    From a random start, a population of mimics might
	    be expected to converge inexorably on a single profile,
	    leading to the conclusion that cultural diversity is imposed
	    by factors that counteract the effects of
	    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformity"
	       target=new>conformist</a> tendencies.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    However, the <I>surprising result</I> was that "the system
	    achieved stable diversity. The minority was able to
	    survive, contrary to the belief that social influence
	    inexorably leads to uniformity."
	  </li>
	</ul>
      </li>
      <li>
	Carley’s (1991) and Axelrod’s (1997) models of social influence.
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    These couple local influence (the tendency for people who
	    interact frequently to become more similar over time) and
	    homophily (the tendency to interact more frequently with
	    similar agents). This closes the loop — the more agents
	    interact, the more similar they become, and the more
	    similar they become, the more likely they are to interact.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    More precisely, neighboring agents on a two-dimensional
	    lattice interact with a likelihood determined by the
	    similarity of their cultural traits (given by a simple,
	    randomly assigned string of numbers). Interaction, in
	    turn, reduces remaining differences.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Axelrod expected this self-reinforcing dynamic would lead
	    inexorably to cultural convergence and
	    homogeneity. Again <I>the result was surprising</I>. He
	    found that "local convergence can lead to global
	    polarization" and that unique subcultures can survive in
	    the face of a seemingly relentless march toward cultural
	    conformity. Stable minority subcultures persist because of
	    the protection of structural holes created by cultural
	    differences that preclude interaction, thereby insulating
	    agents from homogenizing tendencies.
	  </li>
	</ul>
      </li>
      <li>
	Kim & Bearman (1997) model of social contagion.
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    Collective action among agents whose interest in the
	    public good is heavily influenced by social pressure from
	    other participants in their local network. This causes
	    interest in the collective action to spread like a
	    contagion through network channels.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    It was found that participation spreads most effectively
	    within densely clustered subnetworks comprising a critical
	    mass of highly interested primary contributors.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    The conventional wisdom: social pressure to participate is
	    needed to overcome the temptation to free ride. It follows
	    that dependence on the group for social direction promotes
	    compliance with group obligations. Yet a number of
	    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnography"

	    This led Flache & Macy (1996) to investigate the

  <h1>in conclusion: some methodological recommendations</h1>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <I>Start it simple.</I> Analysis of very simple and unrealistic
      models can reveal new theoretical ideas that have broad
      applicability, beyond the stylized models that produced
      them. Pressure to make models more realistic (and agents more
      cognitively sophisticated) is misguided if models become so
      complex that they are as difficult to interpret as natural
      phenomena. ... Models should start out simple and complications
      should be added one at a time, making sure that the dynamics are
      fully understood before proceeding.
    </li>
    <li>
      <I>Avoid reliance on biological metaphors.</I> Is cultural
      evolution the same as genetic? What is the mechanism that
      eliminates poor performers from the population and allows others
      to propagate?  Imitation of the fittest may be more applicable
      than starvation and reproduction, but unlike survival of the
      fittest, mimetic selection replicates only observed behavior and
      does not copy the underlying (unobservable) rules. Biological
      metaphors paper over the importance of this distinction. For
      example, in repeated
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma"
      target=new>Prisoner’s Dilemma</a> games, it is plausible that an
      agent observes and then copies the cooperative behavior of
      successful neighbors, but how does the agent know that this
      behavior is based on a rule (or supergame strategy) like
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tit_for_tat"
      target=new>Tit for Tat</a> and not

      target=new>Win-Stay, Lose-Shift</a> or Always Cooperate that

<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>in conclusion: some methodological recommendations (cont.)</h1>

  <ol start=3>
    <li>
      <I>Experiment, don’t just explore.</I> Agent-based modeling is
      an experimental tool for theoretical research. While important
      discoveries can be made by open-ended exploration of theoretical
      possibilities, researchers need to resist the temptation to
      become freewheeling adventurers in artificial worlds.  Careful,
      systematic mapping of a parameter space may be less engaging,
      but it makes for better science. This requires theoretically
      motivated manipulation of parameters, based on careful review of
      current theoretical and empirical knowledge, and a clear
      statement of the hypotheses that guided the experimental design.
    </li>
    <li>
      <I>Test robustness.</I> Although simulation designs should use
      experimental rather than post-hoc statistical controls to
      identify underlying causal processes, that does not mean
      researchers should avoid statistical analysis of the results.
      On the contrary, ABMs, especially those that include stochastic
      algorithms, require replications that demonstrate the stability
      of the results. Where possible, replications should include
      variation in parameters that are theoretically arbitrary or of
      secondary interest. Authors then need to be careful to
      distinguish between experimental manipulations (where results
      are expected to change with the parameters) and robustness tests
      (where they are not).  
    </li>
    <li>
      <I>Test external validity.</I> Virtual experiments test the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_validity"
      target=new>internal validity</a> of a theory, without which
      there is no need to test the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_validity"
      target=new>external validity</a>. However, this does not mean
      there is never such a need. ABMs are often used to grow familiar
      macrosocial patterns, as a way to identify possible causal
      mechanisms. When this succeeds, researchers need to think about
      ways these mechanisms can be operationalized and tested in
      laboratory or natural conditions.
    </li>
  </ol>

</DIV


<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>in conclusion: some methodological recommendations (cont.)</h1>

  <ol start=6>
    <li>
      <I>Test domain validity.</I> Do two different models of the same
      phenomenon produce the same results? If they do not, find out
      why. Identify the assumptions that are the logical source of
      divergent implications by carefully aligning the
      models. 
    </li>
    <li>
      <I>Bring factors back in.</I> The bottom-up approach in ABMs
      might seem to imply that these models can only be used to test
      microsociological theories.  That is a tragic misunderstanding
      because it precludes what is most exciting to sociologists about
      this methodology. An artificial world populated by computational
      agents is a laboratory in which researchers can manipulate
      structural conditions to test macrosociological theories without
      <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/reification"
      target=new>reifying</a> causal factors at the macro
      level. Contrary to the
      <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/holistic"

      <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/epistemology"
      target=new>epistemology</a> of an earlier generation of
      equation-based simulations, changes in population density or
      network structure, for example, do not directly lead to the
      diffusion of innovations. The causal process is effected through
      individual choices.  Computational experiments in virtual worlds
      provide a rigorous methodology for studying the microfoundations
      of macro dynamics. However, the shift from factors to actors
      should not limit experimenters to manipulation of agent
      attributes (such as cognitive or behavioral
      assumptions). Bringing factors back in as experimental
      manipulations will realize the full potential of agent-based
      modeling, especially in sociology.

  <h1>ABM in social sciences [Axelrod & Tesfatsion]</h1>

  <P>
  <BR>
  The social sciences seek to understand not only how individuals
  behave but also how the interaction of many individuals leads to
  large-scale outcomes. Understanding a political or economic system
  requires more than an understanding of the individuals that comprise
  the system. It also requires understanding how the individuals
  interact with each other, and how the results can be <I>more than the
  sum of the parts</I>.
  <P>
    ABM is well suited for this social science objective. It is a
    method for studying systems exhibiting the following two
    properties:
    <ol>
      <li>
	the system is composed of interacting agents; and
      </li>
      <li>
	the system exhibits <B>emergent</B> properties, that is,
	properties arising from the interactions of the agents that
	cannot be deduced simply by aggregating the properties of the
	agents.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <P>
      When the interaction of the agents is contingent on past
      experience (recall the concept of
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_dependence"
      target=new>path / history dependence</a>), and especially when
      the agents continually adapt to that experience, mathematical
      analysis is typically very limited in its ability to derive the
      dynamic consequences. <I>In this case, ABM might be the only
      practical method of analysis</I>.
    </P>

  <h1>the place of simulation in science</h1>

  <P>
  <BR>
  ABM begins with assumptions about agents and their interactions and
  then uses computer simulation to generate “histories” that can
  reveal the dynamic consequences of these assumptions. Thus, ABM
  researchers can investigate how large-scale effects arise from the
  micro-processes of interactions among many agents. These agents can
  represent people (say consumers, sellers, or voters), but they can
  also represent social groupings such as families, firms,
  communities, government agencies and nations.
  <P>
    Simulation in general, and ABM in particular, is a third way of
    doing science in addition to
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning"
    target=new>deduction</a> and
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning"
    target=new>induction</a>. Scientists use deduction to derive
    theorems from assumptions, and induction to find patterns in
    empirical data. Simulation, like deduction, starts with a set of
    explicit assumptions. But unlike deduction, simulation does not
    prove theorems with generality. Instead, simulation generates data
    suitable for analysis by induction. Nevertheless, unlike typical
    induction, the simulated data come from a rigorously specified set
    of assumptions regarding an actual or proposed system of interest
    rather than direct measurements of the real world. Consequently,
    simulation differs from standard deduction and induction in both
    its implementation and its goals. Simulation permits increased
    understanding of systems through controlled computational
    experiments.

  <h1>the four goals of ABM</h1>

      <ol>
	<li>
	  <I>Empirical understanding.</I> Why have particular
	  large-scale regularities evolved and persisted, even when
	  there is little top-down control? (Examples: standing
	  ovations, trade networks, socially accepted monies, mutual
	  cooperation based on reciprocity, and social norms.) ABM
	  researchers
	  seek <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"
	  target=new>CAUSAL EXPLANATIONS</a> grounded in the repeated
	  interactions of agents operating in specified
	  environments. In particular, they ask whether particular
	  types of observed global regularities can be reliably
	  generated from particular types of agent-based models.
	</li>
	<li>
	  <I>Normative understanding.</I> How can agent-based models
	  be used as laboratories for the discovery of good designs?
	  Will designs proposed for social policies, institutions, or
	  processes result in socially desirable system performance
	  over time? (Examples: design of auction systems, voting
	  rules, and law enforcement.) The general approach is like
	  filling a bucket with water to determine if it leaks. An
	  agent-based world is constructed that captures the salient
	  aspects of a social system operating under the design. The
	  world is then populated with privately motivated agents with
	  learning capabilities and allowed to develop over time. The
	  key issue is the extent to which the resulting world
	  outcomes are efficient, fair, and orderly, despite attempts
	  by these privately motivated agents to gain individual
	  advantage through strategic behavior.

  <h1>the four goals of ABM (cont.)</h1>

  <ol start=3>
    <li>
      <I>Heuristic.</I> How can greater insight be attained about the
      fundamental causal mechanisms in social systems? Even if the
      assumptions used to model a social system are simple, the
      consequences can be far from obvious if the system is composed
      of many interacting agents. The large-scale effects of
      interacting agents are often surprising because it can be hard
      to anticipate the full consequences of even simple forms of
      interaction. For example, one of the earliest and most elegant
      agent-based models — the
      <a href="http://nifty.stanford.edu/2014/mccown-schelling-model-segregation/"
      target=new>city segregation (or “tipping”) model</a> developed
      by
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Schelling"
      target=new>Thomas Schelling</a> — demonstrates how residential
      segregation can emerge from individual choices even when
      everyone is fairly tolerant.
    </li>
    <li>
      <I>Methodological advancement.</I> How best to provide ABM
      researchers with the methods and tools they need to undertake
      the rigorous study of social systems through controlled
      computational experiments? ABM researchers are exploring a
      variety of ways to address this objective ranging from careful
      consideration of methodological principles to the practical
      development of programming and visualization tools.
      <BR>
	ABMs make possible:
      <ol>
	<li>
	  the rigorous testing, refinement, and extension of existing
	  theories that have proved to be difficult to formulate and
	  evaluate using standard statistical and mathematical tools;
	  and
	</li>
	<li>
	  a deeper understanding of fundamental causal mechanisms in
	  multi-agent systems whose study is currently separated by
	  artificial disciplinary boundaries.
