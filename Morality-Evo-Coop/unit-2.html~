	<DIR><DIR> "Extended Evolutionary Synthesis (EES), retains the
	    fundaments of evolutionary theory, but differs in its
	    emphasis on the role of constructive processes in
	    development and evolution, and reciprocal portrayals of
	    causation. In the EES, developmental processes, operating
	    through developmental bias, inclusive inheritance and
	    niche construction, share responsibility for the direction
	    and rate of evolution, the origin of character variation
	    and organism-environment complementarity.  We spell out
	    the structure, core assumptions and novel predictions of
	    the EES, and show how it can be deployed to stimulate and
	    advance research in those fields that study or use
	    evolutionary biology."

    <I>(a) Programed development.</I> Traditionally, development has
    been conceptualized as programed, unfolding according to rules and
    instructions specified within the genome. DNA is ascribed a
    special causal significance, and all other parts of the developing
    organism serve as ‘substrate’, or ‘interpretative machinery’ for
    the expression of genetic information.
    <P>
    <I>(b) Constructive development.</I> By contrast, in the EES,
    genes and genomes represent one of many resources that contribute
    to the developing phenotype. Causation flows both upwards from
    lower levels of biological organization, such as DNA, and from
    higher levels downwards, such as through tissue- and
    environment-specific gene regulation. Exploratory and selective
    processes are important sources of novel and evolutionarily
    significant phenotypic variation. Rather than containing a
    ‘program’, the genome represents a component of the developmental
    system, shaped by evolution to sense and respond to relevant
    signals and to provide materials upon which cells can draw.

    &#182; Mutation pressure refers to the population-level consequences of
    repeated mutation, here depicted as dashed because mutation is
    also represented in ‘processes that generate novel variation’.
    <P>
      ‡ In the EES, this category of processes will often need to be
      broadened to encompass processes that modify the frequencies of
      other heritable resources.
    <P>
      § Developmental bias and niche construction can also affect
      other evolutionary processes, such as mutation, drift and gene
      flow.

  <h1>some conclusions</h1>

  <P>
  <BR>
  "A further benefit potentially comes through strengthening ties to
  adjacent disciplines, such as ecology [76,143,144], or the human
  sciences, including archaeology, biological anthropology,
  developmental psychology, epidemiology and economics [145–150],
  where some of these ideas are already starting to have an impact.
  <P>
  Moreover, other advances in biology potentially take on new
  significance within the EES. For instance, the emphasis on inclusive
  inheritance potentially gives
  <a href"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_selection#Multilevel_selection_theory"
  target=new><I><B>multi-level selection</B></I></a> even greater
  significance, as selection can operate on all forms of heritable
  variation.
  <P>
  Another case is
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome_evolution"
  target=new><I>genome evolution</I></a>, where horizontal gene
  transfer in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prokaryote"
  target=new>prokaryotes</a>, and genetic transfer from
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endosymbiont"
  target=new>endosymbionts</a>
  in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eukaryote"
  target=new>eukaryotes</a> [151], can be understood as part of a
  broader suite of phenomena with the propensity to propagate
  horizontally (e.g. social transmission, ecological inheritance).
  The recognition that genome change is an active cell-mediated
  physiological process that responds to challenging life-history
  events [152] fits neatly with the EES’s treatment of
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotypic_plasticity"
  target=new>plasticity</a>. 
  <P>
  The EES perspective may also facilitate implementation of approaches
  from computer science that enable mathematical representation of
  complex dynamic systems, such as connectionist models of memory and
  learning applied to model
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"
  target=new>genotype</a>
  to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"
  target=new>phenotype</a> relations [153]."
