  <h1>the emergence of conscience</h1>

  <P>
    <ul>
      <li>
	<I>How selfish genes beget selfless beings: the evolution of
	  conscience</I> [Smirnova and Odouard, 2020].
      </li>
    </ul>
  </P>
  <P>
    The Python/Mesa code for this project is available
    <a href="Evolution-Of-Conscience-master.zip" target=zip>HERE</a>
    (courtesy of Diana Smirnova and Victor Odouard).
  </P>
  <P>
    Because our consciences urge cooperation even towards those who
    are not our kin (inclusivity), and even when no one is watching
    (sincerity), it eludes many of the previously given explanations
    for the evolution of cooperation, such as reciprocity, kin
    selection, and even punishment (which can only occur when
    behaviors are observed). While group-level selection is a
    candidate cause, in previous studies of agent-based models has
    demonstrated a limited capacity to evolve cooperation in large
    groups. In our model, conscience is, for the first time,
    represented by more than a simple “always cooperate” strategy, as
    it is affected by the behaviors of other individuals in
    society. We believe this is what allows conscience to grow and
    thrive, even in large societies. Thus, we propose the group-level
    evolution of conscience as a major catalyst for cooperation in
    large (>1000 people) human societies.
  </P>
  
</DIV>



<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>the problem of truly selfless morals</h1>

  <P>
    Ever since Darwin himself pointed it out, it has been known that
    a trait that predisposes its carrier to altriusm is not
    evolutionarily stable.
  </P>
  <P>
    The persistence of predisposition to truly selfless behavior (as
    opposed to mere tit-for-tat) is particularly difficult to explain.
    Conscience, and its constituent moral emotions such as guilt and
    shame, is a powerful force that promotes moral behavior. However,
    there are two characteristics of conscience that make it difficult
    to explain evolutionarily:
    <ul>
      <li>
	<I>Sincerity</I>. Conscience remains in force even when no one
	is looking.
      </li>
      <li>
	<I>Inclusivity</I>. Conscience prods us into altruism towards
	all members of our community–not just our kin.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </P>
  <P>
    Note that sincerity precludes a purely reciprocal explanation for
    conscience, since reciprocity only works when others are aware of
    your actions. Inclusivity, on the other hand, clearly precludes a
    kin-based explanation for conscience.
  </P>
  <P>
    How could sincere and inclusive conscience have evolved? Here, we
    explore whether multi-level selection could have done it, using an
    agent-based model to simulate both the intra- and inter-group
    evolutionary dynamics of societies. Specifically, we explore the
    hypothesis that conscience can act as an internal enforcer of
    cooperation. This in turn makes some societies as an aggregate
    more fit, allowing them to outcompete other societies (as Darwin
    originally proposed).
  </P>
   
</DIV>    
    


<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>the main characteristics of our model</h1>

  <P>
    <ol>
      <li>
	<I>Cooperation/Defection choice</I>: at each time step, each
	agent has a choice of whether to cooperate or defect. These
	choices are abstract, but they can be thought of as
	corresponding to concrete behaviors, such as helping on a
	group hunt, or stealing from the group.
      </li>
      <li>
	<I>Reward scheme</I>: agents who cooperate must pay an
	individual cost to cooperate, but they also produce a public
	benefit greater than the cost they incur. Defectors simply
	free-ride off the public benefit.
      </li>
      <li>
	<I>Individual selection</I>: low-fitness individuals die off,
	while high-fitness individuals survive and pass on their
	strategy to offspring.
      </li>
      <li>
	<I>Inter-group selection</I>: groups compete with each other,
	either through direct conflict or indirect competition for
	resources.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </P>
  <P>
    Notice that individual selection and inter-group selection are in
    conflict. Conscience-equipped individuals under-perform, but
    conscience equipped groups over-perform. Thus, the only way for
    conscience to win out is for the group advantage afforded by
    conscience to outweigh the individual costs.
  </P>
  
</DIV>



<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>clarification of terms</h1>

  <P>
    There are differences between altruistic, cooperative, and
    moral behaviors.  We suggest that they form nested sets:
    $$ \text{altruistic behaviors} \subset \text{cooperative behaviors}
    \subseteq \text{moral behaviors} $$
  </P>
  <P>
    The inclusion of (and perhaps the identity between) the set of
    cooperative behaviors and the set of moral behaviors is supported
    by the study of morality in 60 societies by Curry et al. (2019).
    As for altruism, only a subset of cooperative acts are considered
    altruistic – cooperative acts made voluntarily, in the absence of
    any quid pro quo external rewards. Thus, every altruistic act is
    cooperative, but not every cooperative act is altruistic (for
    instance, reciprocity is cooperative, but altruistic).
  </P>
  <img src="Smirnova20-tab4.png" class="figure-right" height=300>
  <P>
    We define conscience as a combination of
    <ol>
      <li>
	the capacity to absorb moral norms, and
      </li>
      <li>
	internal enforcement of those norms.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </P>
  <P>
    Enforcement is mediated by emotions such as guilt and
    shame. Because it is internal, the acquisition of conscience can
    be thought of as the internalization of community standards.
  </P>

<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>the model</h1>

  <img src="Smirnova20-tab3.png" class="figure-right" height=250>
  <P>
    In a series of rounds, agents choose whether to cooperate or
    defect. In any given round, each agent has a certain probability
    of having its actions observed. Each agent is aware of its
    probability of being caught and can make decisions based on
    this.
  </P>
  <P>
    This allows us to distinguish between sincere and insincere
    strategies. Agents who cooperate even when they have a low
    probability of being observed can be said to have conscience — an
    internal enforcer.
  </P>
  <P>
    Agent strategies are driven by the payoff matrix. In each round,
    every agent gets a base increase \(f\) in fitness. The agents can
    also choose to cooperate, in which case they incur a cost \(c\),
    but produce a benefit \(b > c\), since cooperation should produce
    a benefit greater in sum than the costs incurred by the individual
    agents (why else would cooperation be beneficial?). Agents who are
    observed to have defected do not receive any of the collective
    benefit, while everyone else gets an equal share, represented by
    \(\bar{b}\). Therefore, this model contains an element of
    punishment, but only for observed defectors. This leaves room for
    conniving agents to cooperate only when they are likely to be
    observed (the antithesis of conscience).
  </P>
   
</DIV>    
    
  

  
<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>the four types of agents</h1>

  <P>
    Each agent is characterized by one of four strategies, which guide
    their decision on whether to cooperate or defect. Their strategy
    corresponds to the “default choice,” which they will follow with
    probability \(1−\epsilon\); with probability probability
    \(\epsilon\) they deviate from their default choice.
    <ol>
      <li>
	<I>Miscreants</I> defect by default.
      </li>
      <li>
	<I>Deceivers</I> essentially act as reward-maximizers, by
	predicting cooperation and defection payoffs. These are
	estimated from the benefits of cooperation from the previous
	round and their probability of being observed in the current
	round. Expected payoff from cooperating is calculated as \(f_c
	= f − c + \bar{b}_{t−1}\) and the expected payoff from
	defecting as \(f_d = f + (1 − p_{obs}) \bar{b}_{t−1}\). When
	\(f_c \geq f_d\), they cooperate by default; otherwise, they
	defect by default.
      </li>
      <li>
	<I>Citizens</I> act based on how many agents cooperated in the
	previous round. When the proportion of other agents that
	cooperated reached a threshold \(T\), they cooperate by
	default; otherwise, they act as reward-maximizers.
      </li>
      <li>
	<I>Saints</I> cooperate by default.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </P>
  <P>
    Note that deceivers may act cooperatively at times, but never
    altruistically: their cooperation is always
    self-interested. Citizens, on the other hand, can be said to have
    a conscience, because their morality (the choice to cooperate)
    does not depend on whether or not they are being watched.  That
    said, citizens only feel pressure from their conscience <I>if
    other agents are cooperating</I>. Thus, conscience is often
    conditioned on the feeling that those around you are doing their
    part, but importantly, not on the likelihood of getting caught.
  </P>
  
</DIV>    
    


<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>multilevel selection</h1>

  <P>
    The agents of various types compete with each other through a
    mechanism of survival and reproduction: agents with lower fitness
    are more likely to die, and agents with higher fitness are more
    likely to reproduce (and pass their strategy on to their
    offspring). This occurs in such a way as to keep group sizes
    constant.
  </P>
  <P>
    This individual selection process will clearly favor the
    reward-maximizers. To incorporate multi-level selection, we also
    include a mechanism by which groups are randomly paired, and, with
    some probability, engage in conflict. The likelihood of victory
    for group \(i\) in a conflict with group \(j\) is

    $$
    \frac{1}{2} \left(1 + \frac{F_i − F_j}{F_i + F_j}\right)
    $$
    
    where \(F_i\) is the aggregate fitness of group \(i\). The higher
    group \(i\)’s aggregate fitness is in comparison to group \(j\),
    the more likely group \(i\) is to be victorious.
  </P>
  <P>
    The level of cooperation within a group is directly proportional
    to aggregate fitness of its members, so groups with higher levels
    of cooperation have a higher average fitness than groups with
    lower levels of cooperation or no cooperation at all. Thus,
    cooperative groups have an advantage in conflicts against other
    groups.
  </P>
  <P>
    Now, if the citizens manage to outcompete the deceivers, it would
    be a momentous achievement.  After all, deceivers are
    reward-maximizers. The dominance of citizens, then, would signify
    (at least the start of) a transfer of evolutionary focus from the
    individual to the group.
  </P>
  
</DIV>


 
  
<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>effects of benefit-to-cost ratio and base fitness</h1>

  <img src="Smirnova20-fig1.png" class="figure-right" height=400>
  <P>
    We found that group-level selection was sufficient to bring about
    the evolution of conscience, when the ratio of the public benefit
    to individual cost was high enough. This result persisted even as
    group sizes became large, of over one thousand members.
  </P>
  <P>
    Almost all simulations we ran ended with either complete dominance
    of the miscreant-deceiver population, or complete dominance of the
    citizen-saint population. <small> Once these equilibria were
    reached, the two surviving agent types would either always defect
    (in the former case) or always cooperate (in the latter case) so
    they became essentially evolutionarily indistinguishable and one
    type did not go on to dominate the other. However,
    pre-stabilization, citizens tended to outperform saints, since
    they are harder to take advantage of, and thus usually saints were
    less numerous in final equilibria.  An analogous observation holds
    for deceivers and miscreants: pre-stabilization, deceivers tended
    to perform better than miscreants, since they could cooperate if
    it would likely be personally advantageous (for instance, if they
    were very likely to get caught in defection). However, once
    matters stabilized to an all-defection scenario, getting caught
    was immaterial since the punishment in our model was deprivation
    from the group benefit–but when everyone is defecting, there is no
    group benefit to be deprived of.</small>
  </P>
  <P>
    By far the most important factor in determining whether conscience
    could evolve was the ratio of group benefit to individual
    cost. Almost all simulations we ran with the 3.25 ratio converged
    to all-defection scenarios, while the simulations with the 3.75
    almost always converged to all-cooperation scenarios. Thus there
    is a clear tipping point here–only a small change in this ratio
    leads us from one extreme to another. Base fitness was also a very
    influential factor, especially at the frontier.
  </P>

  
</DIV>    
    


  
<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>effect of migration rate</h1>

  <img src="Smirnova20-fig2.png" class="figure-right" height=250>
  <P>
    We had expected that migration would have a negative effect on the
    evolution of conscience. This is because conscience, under our
    hypothesis, requires us to treat the group, rather than the
    individual, as the ultimate unit of selection. But if there is a
    high level of migration between groups, the unit cohesion of the
    group is compromised.
  </P>
  <P>
    The findings, however, were not so simple.  First, the migration
    rate was certainly a secondary factor to the benefit-to-cost
    ratio. We experimented with the migration rate at the
    frontier–that is, with a benefit-to-cost ratio equal to 3.5, and
    we observed a U-shaped pattern in its impact.
    <small>
    <ol>
      <li>
	With a migration rate of 0, all runs stabilized to
	citizen-saint dominance.
      </li>
      <li>
	With a migration rate of 0.1, deceiver-miscreant dominance
	occurred in a minority of runs: 13 runs ended with virtual
	citizen saint dominance (fewer than 3% defectors, usually 0),
	6 runs ended with absolute deceiver-miscreant dominance, and 1
	was somewhat ambiguous with mostly citizen-saint dominance,
	but 1000 straggling deceivers.
      </li>
      <li>
	With a migration rate of 0.2, the results were similar to 0.1:
	13 runs ended with citizen-saint dominance, and 7 with
	deceiver-miscreant dominance. Interestingly, here all
	dominance was absolute: each run ended with 100%
	miscreant-deceiver, or 100% saint-citizen.
      </li>
      <li>
	With a migration rate of 0.3, 18 runs ended with citizen-saint
	dominance and 2 with deceivermiscreant dominance. Again,
	dominance of either type of agent was absolute.
      </li>
      <li>
	With a migration rate of 0.4, or 0.5, all runs ended with
	citizen-saint dominance.
      </li>
    </ol>
    </small>
  </P>
   
</DIV>    
    


  
<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>effect of conflict rate</h1>

  <img src="Smirnova20-fig3.png" class="figure-right" height=250>
  <P>
    Group conflict, on the other hand, had more predictable
    results. For a rate of 0 (no conflict), citizensaints only
    dominated in 4 out of 20 runs. Then with a rate of 0.1, they
    dominated in 12 runs, peaking at a rate of 0.3 with citizen-saint
    dominance in 19 out of 20 runs. This, of course, is what we
    expect: in this model, conflict is the driver of group-level
    selection.
  </P>
   
</DIV>    
    


  
<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>starting at a disadvantage</h1>

  <P>
    Most of our runs started out with equal numbers of miscreants,
    deceivers, saints, and citizens. To find out whether or not a
    small population of citizens or saints can “take over” if they
    start off as a minority (which they are likely to be when they
    first evolve), we tried starting with an initial distribution
    dominated by deceivers and miscreants.
  </P>
  <P>
    In these runs, only 2% of the agent population started off as
    citizens or saints.  At our frontier, with a benefit-to-cost equal
    to 3.5, conscience was never able to make it out–all runs ended
    with a deceiver-miscreant dominance. In fact, a benefit to cost
    ratio of 7, double that of our usual frontier, was required for
    conscience to come up from behind. With this value, 17 out of 20
    runs in citizen-saint dominance.
  </P>
  <P>
    We also tried another scenario, in which there was a single group
    completely dominated by citizens and saints. Could this group, due
    to its greater efficiency, outcompete the others and thus multiply
    across the map? Perhaps surprisingly, the answer was no, at least
    with the migration rate we had been using. We had to reduce
    migration to 1/10 of the initial parameter value (from 0.1 to
    0.01) before certain runs ended with citizen-saint-dominance. With
    a migration rate of 0.01, 12 of 20 runs ended in citizen-saint
    dominance, whereas with a rate of 0.1, all runs ended with
    deceiver-miscreant dominance.

<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>discussion: level transitions</h1>

  <P>
    One way to think about this research is that it studies the
    question, at what point does the dominance of one level of natural
    selection (the social group) surpass the level below it?
  </P>
  <P>
    Our major finding is that the primary quantity of interest is the
    ratio of group benefit to individual cost. Specifically, the
    benefit-to-cost ratio seems to have some threshold, which might
    depend on certain parameters such as migration, after which the
    individual loses priority to the group.
  </P>
  <P>
    Interestingly, this threshold seems to be robust to changes in
    group size. In our case, this threshold was about
    3.5. Furthermore, reaching this threshold leads to a sudden tip
    from one extreme to the other. There is no stability in the middle
    ground.
  </P>
   
</DIV>    
    


  
<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>the initial bump</h1>

  <P>
    The "threshold" benefit-to-cost ratio of 3.5 is quite high. A
    species that knows how to cooperate this well must have gradually
    worked up to this high efficiency-of-cooperation. How could this
    have happened?
  </P>
  <P>
    It is something like a chicken-and-egg situation. Conscience
    encourages cooperation. But in order for conscience to evolve, the
    benefits of cooperation must be extremely high. Thus, there needs
    to be an initial, non-conscience, catalyst of cooperation, that
    allows the species to “practice” cooperating.  Through this
    practice, a species can gradually increase the benefit-to-cost
    ratio of cooperation.
  </P>
  <P>
    This seems to be the role that self-interested cooperation
    mechanisms, such as mutualistic cooperation, reciprocity, and kin
    altruism, played in the beginning. These, after all, were the
    first types of cooperation to evolve–they exist widely throughout
    the animal kingdom, contrary to conscience. It is plausible that
    they provided that initial bump, in a sense, that allowed
    cooperation to pull itself up by its bootstraps in the human
    population. Then, once the conscience threshold was met, the
    conditions for conscience to mushroom throughout the population
    became ripe. Thus, initial cooperation sets off a positive
    feedback loop, by allowing conscience to evolve, which
    subsequently sparks even greater cooperation.

<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>emergence and stability</h1>

  <img src="" class="figure-right" height=250>
  <P>
    Is a conscience-dominated equilibrium, in which all groups exhibit
    dominance of citizens and saints, stable?
  </P>
  <P>
    From our experimental results, the answer seems to be a tentative
    yes. Whenever, in our simulations, the number of
    miscreant-deceivers dipped below a certain level, they would
    invariably go all the way down to zero.

  <P>The dynamics of this are probably quite interesting an deserve to

    free-rider might be able to do quite well in a society where
    everyone is dutifully producing a public good. Here we hypothesize
    that any group that succumbs to an invasion of deceivers would
    quickly get quashed by another group that has achieved full
    cooperation.
  </P>
  <P>
    We found that a minority of groups that have come to be dominated
    by conscience-possessing individuals can go on to outcompete
    groups of more selfish individuals, eventually replacing
    them. However, this only occurs when migration rates are very
    low. When migration rates are too high, deceiver-miscreant
    populations begin to infiltrate the small number of conscience
    groups and “destroy them from within” by free-riding off of the
    altruistic individuals in those groups. Thus, the conditions for
    the initial emergence of conscience and the initial spread of
    conscience are both relatively delicate.

  <h1>summary</h1>

  <P>
    We examined a simple group selection mechanism for the evolution
    of conscience and found that even with large group sizes (> 1000)
    conscience – and thus cooperation — was able to flourish.
  </P>
  <P>
    Earlir work on the evolution of conscience found that group
    selection failed to produce cooperation in large societies [Boyd
    et al., 2003]. How was our simulation different?
    <ol>
      <li>
	 It contained more sophisticated cooperation strategies, which
	 as it turns out, more accurately mirror how our conscience
	 actually works. Many simulations in the past consisted simply
	 of a mix of unsophisticated cooperators and defectors. In our
	 model, we included the <I>citizen</I> strategy: “cooperate as
	 long as others are cooperating”. Its inclusion was essential
	 to the survival of conscience-possessing individuals — saints
	 alone would not have made it.
      </li>
      <li>
	Our model included punishment: defectors who were caught were
	punished for the transgression by being deprived of the group
	benefit.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </P>
  <P>
    Of course, conscience did not evolve under all circumstances. By
    far the most important factor was the benefit-to-cost ratio of
    cooperation. In fact, factors that we might have believed would
    play extremely important roles either had much less pronounced
    effects, or produced effects in unexpected ways. Migration had a
    U-shaped impact on the evolution of conscience, and group size
    barely played a role at all.

  <h1>some open questions</h1>

  <P>
    <ul>
      <li>
	Why does group size play such a small role in level-changes?
	Answering this would probably requiring knowing the particular
	dynamics of a high benefit-to-cost ratio system that make it
	so conducive to a level-switch, even when group sizes are
	big.
      </li>
      <li>
	What if observation probability decreased as society size
	increased?
      </li>
      <li>
	Could conscience have evolved even in the absence of the
	punishment mechanism that we had in place?
      </li>
    </ul>
