      This paper describes a computational model
      of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiebout_model"
      target=new>Tiebout</a> competition and shows that political
      institutions differ in their ability to sort citizens
      effectively. In particular, we find that certain types of
      institutions — those that become more "politically unstable" as
      citizen heterogeneity increases — perform relatively poorly
      given a single jurisdiction, yet these same institutions perform
      relatively well when there are multiple jurisdictions.  An
      explanation for this phenomenon is offered, which draws upon
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing"
       target=new>simulated annealing</a>, a discrete nonlinear
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_algorithm"

  <h1>introduction</h1>

  <P>
    Political or economic institutions are often evaluated by their
    ability to structure micro-level incentives to be in agreement
    with macro-level goals. In many important situations, micro- level
    incentives are consistent with multiple equilibria, and one role
    of institutions may be to steer agents in the direction of
    configurations of highest aggregate utility.
  </P>
  <P>
    This paper compares the performance of three common political
    institutions — (i) democratic referenda, (ii) direct competition,
    and (iii) proportional representation — in a model of Tiebout
    competition. We examine the ability of alternative political
    institutions to induce better sorting of citizens among competing
    local jurisdictions, where better sorting means higher aggregate
    utility among citizens.
  </P>
  <P>
    While the focus of this paper is on Tiebout models, the underlying
    process we analyze — the decentralized sorting of interacting
    individuals — is of much broader interest, playing a role in labor
    markets, industrial location, and coalition formation.
  </P>
  <P>
    In a Tiebout model, local jurisdictions compete for citizens by
    offering bundles of public goods. Citizens then sort themselves
    among jurisdictions according to their preferences. Our focus on
    dynamics (as opposed to final equilibrium states), and the use of
    institutions that resemble those actually employed (versus a
    fictional, profit-maximizing entrepreneur), distinguish our work
    from prior research on the Tiebout hypothesis.
  </P>
   
</DIV>    
    


<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>the model</h1>

  <P>
    We construct a simple version of a Tiebout world. Agents
    (citizens) seek their favorite location from among a fixed set of
    jurisdictions each of which offers a particular
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_platform"
    target=new>platform</a> of local public goods and policies. Each
    jurisdiction's platform is then determined by a political
    institution that aggregates the preferences of the agents
    currently residing in the jurisdiction. Once new platforms are
    determined, agents are allowed to move, and the above process is
    iterated. Agents do not take into account the effects of their own
    movements on future policies.
  </P>
  <P>
    There are \(N_a\) agents, each residing in one of \(N_j\) possible
    jurisdictions. Within any jurisdiction, the local government must
    decide binary (Yes/No) positions on a set of \(N_i\) local public
    issues (examples: whether or not to build a community swimming
    pool; whether or not to allow smoking in public buildings).
  </P>
  <P>
    Let \(p_{ji} \in \{Yes, No\}\) be the position of jurisdiction
    \(j\) on issue \(i\); the vector of those is the platform
    \(\textbf{P}_j \in \{Yes, No\}^{N_i}\). The utility of agent \(a\)
    from \(\textbf{P}_j\) is
    $$
    u_a(\textbf{P}_j) = \sum_1^{N_i} \nu_{ai}\cdot \delta(p_{ji})
    $$
    where \(\delta(Yes)=1\) and \(\delta(No)=0\). The expected value
    to an agent of an arbitrary platform is 0, and the expected
    value of its optimal platform is 100. 
  </P>

<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>political institutions</h1>

  <P>
    <ul>
      <li>
	<B>Democratic referenda</B>: simple majority rule on each
	issue. Generally speaking, democratic
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendum"
	target=new>referenda</a> adopt platforms of relatively high
	aggregate utility given a group of agents. Democratic
	referenda are relatively stable, since the implied platform is
	unique and in- dividual agents migrating into or out of a
	jurisdiction rarely change the platform.
      </li>
      <li>
	<B>Direct Competition</B>:
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plurality_voting"
	target=new>winner-take-all plurality voting</a> among parties
	advocating different platforms. Each agent votes for the party
	proposing the platform that yields for it the highest utility;
	the winning party wholly implements its platform in the
	jurisdiction. Direct competition may not be as stable as
	democratic referenda: policy predictions cannot be guaranteed
	to produce unique solutions without severe restrictions on
	preferences.
      </li>
      <li>
	<B>Proportional Representation</B>: each agent votes for a
	single party, and each party receives a number of seats in a
	decision-making body
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_representation"
	target=new>proportional to its popular vote</a>. The present
	models assumes no distortion between the percentage of the
	vote that a party receives and the percentage of seats it
	obtains in the legislature.
	</li>
      </ul>
  </P>
   
</DIV>    
 


<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>parties</h1>

  <P>
    Parties are modeled as incrementally adaptive and incompletely
    informed. This contrasts with standard rational choice approaches
    in which parties are either completely informed optimizers (with
    knowledge of each voter's utility function) or act as
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference"
    target=new>Bayesians</a>.
  </P>
  <P>
    In reality, practical considerations impose restrictions on a
    party's computational ability, the amount and type of information
    it has access to, and on the maximum allowable policy change it
    can make in any one election. For example, parties rely on
    imperfect and imprecise polling data to gather information about
    voters' preferences, and must restrict platform changes from year
    to year to maintain both credibility and a coherent organization.
  </P>
  <P>
    Adaptivity is modeled by
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_climbing"
    target=new>hill-climbing</a>. A randomly generated current
    platform is given to each party prior to any elections. When a
    party is given a chance to adapt, it first generates a new
    platform by randomly perturbing its current platform on up to
    three issues. Thus, the new platform is constrained to lie in a
    neighborhood of the current one. If the new platform yields a
    higher vote total, it becomes the party's current platform; other-
    wise the current platform remains unchanged. This search process
    continues for eight iterations. Hill-climbing always bases its
    search on the current best-known platform. After the eighth
    iteration, another party is given a similar chance to adapt. After
    each party adapts, we return to the first party and begin a new
    cycle of adaptation.

  <P>
    All results are from a model with 1,000 agents and 11 binary
    issues. 
  </P>
  <P>
    First, each agent is assigned random preferences and placed in a
    random jurisdiction. Next, a series of ten Tiebout cycles is
    initiated. In each cycle, agents are first allowed to
    relocate. Each agent then moves to the jurisdiction which offers
    it the highest utility. Each jurisdiction then modifies its
    platform. Under democratic referenda, it adopts the median
    position on each issue. With direct competition and proportional
    representation, parties alternate adapting their platforms via
    hill-climbing.
  </P>
   
</DIV>    
    


<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>multiple jurisdictions</h1>

  <img src="Kollman97-tab2.png" height=275>
  <P>
    With multiple jurisdictions agents can begin to sort according to
    their preferences. As long as jurisdictions are responsive to
    constituencies, aggregate utility should be nondecreasing in the
    number of jurisdictions, and will likely increase as multiple
    jurisdictions are better able to sort agents by preferences.
    Indeed, for all institutions considered, per capita utility
    increases with the number of jurisdictions. The addition of even a
    few jurisdictions allows a dramatic increase in utility.
  </P>
  <P>
    While the increase in utility was expected, what was not
    anticipated was that the performance of the various political
    institutions completely reverses. Democratic referenda, which were
    best in the one-jurisdiction model, are now worst, while
    proportional representation now performs best. With seven or more
    jurisdictions, three-party proportional representation is
    significantly better than two-party direct competition, which is
    significantly better than democratic referenda.

  </P>

<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>mathematical insight into the optimization power of political instability</h1>

  <P>
    With multiple jurisdictions, the lack of a unique outcome — in
    other words, the <B>instability</B> associated with a political
    institution — may induce sorting and increase aggregate
    utility. This increase in utility requires a temporary decrease of
    utility in a given jurisdiction in order to induce agent
    migration. However, the migration eventually leads to a higher
    aggregate utility for the overall system.
  </P>
  <P>
    Specifically, democratic referenda yielded a unique platform in
    each jurisdiction, while direct competition led to instability,
    because it may alternate platforms from among those available in
    the top-cycle set. This instability can be interpreted
    as <I>making mistakes</I>, in the sense that the platforms chosen
    by direct competition typically have lower utility than the median
    platforms generated by democratic referenda. As this study showed,
    these mistakes can be useful in the long run, as they allow the
    system to break out of old equilibrium and to form new
    configurations of agents that promote the creation of new,
    utility-improving equilibria.
  </P>
  <P>
    Mathematically, this resembles
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"
    target=new>optimization</a> by
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing"
    target=new>simulated annealing</a>. Institutions that make more
    mistakes in relatively low-valued configurations will enable the
    system to act "as if" it recognizes the potential value of a local
    optimum and to escape inferior equilibria.
  </P>
<!--
  <P>
    The dynamics of the present model generate this fortuitous bias in
    error-making. If agents in a configuration are not very
    homogeneous at each jurisdiction, aggregate utility will be low,
    and direct competition will generate new platforms which render
    the existing configuration unstable. If, however, the agents in a
    configuration are homogeneous at each jurisdiction, aggregate
    utility will be high and platforms will be stable. Thus, Tiebout
    equilibria with respect to direct competition are biased towards
    those platforms and agent configurations with higher aggregate
    utility.

  <h1>the power of political instability (cont.)</h1>

  <img src="Kollman97-tab4.png" height=300>
  <P>
    If instability in the better performing institutions induces
    superior sorting, then we should observe significantly more
    relocations of agents under the better institutions. This table
    shows the average number of agent relocations observed during each
    ten- cycle trial. As predicted, the performance of a given
    institution is closely tied to the number of relocations
    observed.

<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>conclusions</h1>

  <P>
    In a model of Tiebout competition with multiple jurisdictions,
    some political institutions perform better than others by inducing
    better agent sorting and thereby generating higher aggregate
    utility. Ironically, these same institutions often perform
    relatively poorly in a single-jurisdiction model. The reason for
    this performance reversal is that multiple jurisdictions create a
    system with multiple equilibria. A minor mistake, which is harmful
    in the single-jurisdiction model, may be beneficial in the
    multiple-jurisdiction model since it can dislodge the system from
    a relatively bad local optimum, and induce agents to re-sort
    themselves into a better configuration.
  </P>
  <P>
    The notion that institutions can act as natural annealing
    mechanisms may be useful in understanding the dynamic behavior and
    performance characteristics of many other systems. Tiebout models
    are just one example of a broad class of phenomena that must
    "sort" agents among alternative configurations with multiple
    equilibria. Other examples include traders pairing off in markets,
    laborers finding jobs, firms choosing production sites or product
    attributes, and individuals forming organizations. Under
    decentralized sorting mechanisms, these systems may get trapped in
    suboptimal configurations. If, however, there are means by which
    these poor configurations can be annealed in an appropriate
    manner, then the global system can escape these traps and achieve
    superior outcomes.
