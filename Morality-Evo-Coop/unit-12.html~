  <h1>inequality</h1>

  <P>
  <BR>
    <ul>
      <li>
	<I>The spread of inequality</I> [Rogers, Deshpande, and Feldman, 2011].
      </li>
    </ul>
  </P>
  <P>
    The causes of socioeconomic inequality have been debated since the
    time of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato"
    target=new>Plato</a>. Many reasons for the development of
    stratification have been proposed, from the need for hierarchical
    control over large-scale irrigation systems to the accumulation of
    small differences in wealth over time via inheritance processes.
    However, none of these explains how unequal societies came to
    completely displace egalitarian cultural norms over time.
  </P>
  <P>
    This study models demographic consequences associated with the
    unequal distribution of resources in stratified
    societies. Agent-based simulation results show that in constant
    environments, unequal access to resources can be demographically
    destabilizing, resulting in the outward migration and spread of
    such societies even when population size is relatively small. In
    variable environments, stratified societies spread more and are
    also better able to survive resource shortages by sequestering
    mortality in the lower classes. The predictions of our simulation
    are provided modest support by a range of existing empirical
    studies. In short, the fact that stratified societies today vastly
    outnumber egalitarian societies may not be due to the
    transformation of egalitarian norms and structures, but may
    instead reflect the more rapid migration of stratified societies
    and consequent conquest or displacement of egalitarian societies
    over time.
  </P>
  
</DIV>



<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>introduction and motivation of the study</h1>

  <P>
    Early foraging societies enforced social and economic leveling to
    prevent any individual or group from acquiring more status,
    authority, or resources than others. A central adaptation of human
    evolution may have been the
    <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/204166"
    target=new>suppression of older dominance instincts</a> through
    egalitarian cultural norms. Early societies were less complex and
    more equal than societies arising over the past 10,000 years. How
    did stratified societies with institutionalized inequality become
    dominant during the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolithic"
    target=new>Neolithic period</a>?
  </P>
  <P>
    Some of the explanations offered:
    <ul>
      <li>
	Population growth led to the need for
	agriculture, which generated surplus and required managers and
	other specialized roles, leading to various classes.
      </li>
      <li>
	Resource depletion necessitated further expansion, conflict
	and conquest, which resulted in greater hierarchy.
      </li>
      <li>
	Natural tendencies toward selfishness and dominance
	may impart individual selective advantage.
      </li>
      <li>
	Socioeconomic stratification promotes cooperation or confers
	economic and organizational efficiencies that enable societies
	to cope with new technologies, larger populations, competition
	and conflict.
      </li>
      <li>
	Patchy landscapes, private property and inheritance mechanisms
	lead to the accumulation of small differences in wealth over
	time.
      </li>
    </ul>
  <P>
    None of these explain the dynamics of the process by which unequal
    societies displaced more egalitarian societies.
  </P>

<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>demic diffusion as a possible explanation</h1>

  <P>
    Why did early <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastoralism"
    target=new>pastoralists</a> and agriculturalists relinquish a
    communal approach to property and cease to enforce the leveling
    mechanisms that had previously prevented individual differences
    and stochastic economic shocks from resulting in permanent
    inequalities?
  </P>
  <P>
    Empirical data on cultural transmission indicate that norms,
    values, social structures and other foundational features of
    culture tend to be transmitted conservatively and vertically
    within groups. Such communally-held traits are not likely to be
    altered by individual choices or by transmission from group to
    group. However, they may instead spread through demic
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"
    target=new>diffusion</a>; i.e. population growth or migration of
    the groups carrying the culture.
  </P>
  <P>
    We hypothesize, therefore, that the spread of socioeconomic
    stratification may have been a result of cultural change via demic
    diffusion. In other words, socioeconomic stratification may have
    spread across the globe over the past several thousand years, not
    because it provided apparent advantages that led to its adoption
    by egalitarian cultures, but because it altered demographic
    outcomes in ways that produced an increase in frequency of
    stratified populations, through population expansion or the
    outward migration of populations in search of additional territory
    and resources.
  </P>
  <P>
    To explore this hypothesis, we developed an explicit quantitative
    demographic model of the process, ran various agent-based
    simulation trials, developed predictions based on model results,
    and tested some of these using available data.

    <P>
      Egalitarian populations (A) are able to stabilize, although no
      logistic or density-dependent growth function was used, while
      stratified populations (B, C, D) cannot stabilize because upper
      classes continue to thrive even as resources are being depleted.
    </P>
    <P>
      <small>
	This is an unexpected outcome in a complex system.  Reaching
	this balance appears to depend on the stochastically
	determined magnitude of the rebound following a population
	crash.  Stratified populations were never able to stabilize
	because the upper classes continued to thrive even as
	resources were being depleted and the population was headed
	for trouble. In other words, stratification disrupted
	stabilizing feedback in the system. However, stratified
	populations did not cause more resource depletion, as
	originally predicted on the basis of excess resource
	consumption by upper classes. Instead, stratified populations
	in our simulation depleted the resource base significantly
	less because high mortality rates in lower classes kept the
	total population relatively low compared to carrying capacity.

  <h1>egalitarian and stratified populations in constant and variable environments, with and without storage of surplus</h1>

  <img src="Rogers11-fig2.png" class="figure-right" height=600>
    <P>
      [Black bars: no storage; white bars: storage.]  Egalitarians
      have larger, more stable populations in constant environments
      (A, C); storage causes them to overshoot carrying capacity and
      go extinct (E). In variable environments, egalitarian
      populations are unstable and go extinct (B, D, F). Stratified
      groups have smaller, less stable populations in constant
      environments (A, C), and are more likely to go extinct (E). In
      variable environments, stratified populations are protected
      against extinctions because mortality is sequestered in the
      lower classes; storage gives further protection (B, D, F).
    </P>
    <P>
      <small>
	Stratified groups have a lower mean population size than
	egalitarians, both because the upper classes reduce the
	carrying capacity by taking extra resources, and because lower
	classes suffer high mortality. Resource storage raises the
	population size slightly for stratified groups but not for
	egalitarians.  In constant environments, egalitarians have no
	extinctions without storage, but storage causes them to
	overshoot carrying capacity by a greater amount, leading to
	extinctions. In variable environments, egalitarians have very
	unstable populations and go extinct rapidly; storage does not
	afford them protection. Stratification protects populations
	against environmental variation because mortality in bad years
	is sequestered in the lower classes, allowing upper classes to
	survive, while in egalitarian societies the entire population
	is at risk.

  <h1>discussion</h1>

  <P>
    These simulation results support the hypothesis that
    socioeconomic stratification may have spread due to its effects
    on the demography of small groupsâ€”i.e. by demic diffusionâ€”rather
    than cultural adoption.
  </P>
  <P>
    The demic diffusion shown in our model is based not on population
    expansion but rather on migration due to population
    instability. If demic diffusion were simply a function of
    population growth, then in constant environments egalitarians
    would take over sites available for colonization much more
    rapidly. In our demographic simulation, however, three different
    plausible migration triggers all lead stratified groups to take
    over unoccupied sites faster.
  </P>
  <P>
    In constant environments, inequalities in resource allocation
    appear to disrupt the feedback between population growth and
    resource depletion, preventing stratified groups from achieving an
    equilibrium size and driving them to migrate more despite their
    smaller populations. In variable environments, stratified groups
    migrate more and are less likely to go extinct than egalitarian
    groups. While rapid migration and protection against extinction in
    variable environments may be viewed as an adaptive advantage of
    stratification, it is more probably a result of individual
    selection, as certain individuals survive at the expense of
    resource deprivation and mortality for others.
  </P>
  <P>
    Structure or stratification of populations have been identified as
    important keys to game theoretic models on the evolution of
    cooperation. In a spatial network-based
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma"
    target=new>Prisonerâ€™s Dilemma game</a>, inequality (the presence
    of high-ranking cooperative individuals) counterintuitively
    promoted the evolution of cooperation by providing successful
    nodes around which other cooperators could cluster.

  <h1>discussion (cont.)</h1>

  <P>
    There is evidence for higher migration rates from countries with
    greater inequality.  After controlling for a countryâ€™s wealth (GNP
    per capita) and unemployment rate, Liebig and Sousa-Poza (2004)
    found a strong and significant relationship between income
    inequality
    (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient"
    target=new>Gini coefficient</a> and other income disparity
    measures) and propensity to emigrate out of 23 countries (survey
    of 28,000 individuals).  Stark (2006) developed a model to explain
    these results, showing that if total income is held constant,
    total relative deprivation, and thus, according to his model,
    desire to emigrate, is positively related to income inequality
    (Gini coefficient).
  </P>
  <P>
    In our simulation, upper classes co-opt a disproportionate share
    of resources, leaving lower classes to bear the brunt of any
    mortality caused by resource shortages. Empirical studies suggest
    that this may actually occur. Historical data on changes in
    mortality as prices and production of food fluctuated from year to
    year across Europe and in China showed that in response to a 4â€“ 6%
    average consumption decline, the increase in mortality ranged from
    less than 0% (i.e. mortality actually decreased) to over 15%,
    depending on gender, age group, and socioeconomic class.
  </P>
  <P>
    Case histories from the archeological literature on the spread of
    stratified societies constitute a rich source of relevant
    observations.  As a test of the explanatory powers of our model,
    we summarized 15 such studies without regard to their implications
    for our predictions. We noted whether the following indicators,
    predicted by our model, were observed in conjunction with the rise
    of stratified societies: unequal allocation of resources,
    population instability, migration, conflict, storage of surplus,
    variable environments, and increased frequency of stratified
    societies through their spread rather than through internal
    development.  The results of this analysis (see
    <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0024683.s001&type=supplementary"
    target=new>Supporting Information S1</a>) provide modest support
    for our model.

  <h1>conclusions</h1>

  <P>
    Our hypothesis fits available data relatively well, and should be
    tested with additional empirical data, both contemporary and
    ethnographic. This is not simply an academic exercise.
    Socioeconomic inequality may promote conflict within and between
    ethnic groups, classes and societies, and drive international
    immigration, as mentioned above. It appears to raise prevalence of
    poor health, mental illness, crime, violence, and other societal
    ills. Inequality reduces cultural diversity through disempowerment
    of local minority communities. It may harm working relationships
    within businesses, inhibit economic growth in developing
    countries, reduce sustainability, promote corruption, and play a
    role in destabilizing economies. Perhaps most dangerously,
    <I>inequality erodes trust and blocks cooperative solutions to
    urgent social, economic and political problems</I>.  Understanding
    the causes and consequences of inequality is clearly one of the
    central challenges of the social sciences.
  </P>
  <P>
    Our further research on this
    critical topic will attempt to identify behavioral traits that
    tend to increase in frequency in unequal societies, as well as
    leverage points for shifting societies towards greater stability
    and social sustainability.
