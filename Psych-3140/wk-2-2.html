    disembodied and identical machines, the life of behavior
    perishes. Here, we distill three biological principles, spell out
    their consequences for the study of animal behavior, and
    illustrate them with various examples from the literature.
  </P>
  <P>
    <B>We propose to put behavior back into context</B>, with the
    brain in a species-typical body and with the animal’s body
    situated in the world; stamp Newtonian time with nested
    ontogenetic and phylogenetic processes that give rise to
    individuals with their own histories; and supplement linear
    cause-and-effect chains and information processing with circular
    loops of purpose and meaning.  We believe that conceiving behavior
    in these ways is imperative for neuroscience."

  <P>
    "Chimps use sticks to gather honey, termites, and ants from the
    ground or trees in order to eat them without getting stung, bit,
    or pinched. We can use this behavior to illustrate how
    <B>materiality, agency, and historicity</B> contribute to an
    explanation.
  </P>
  <P>
    <small> The goal of tool-using in this case is to acquire
    energy. This goal belongs to a hierarchy of goals: a higher level
    than having enough energy is the goal of not dying; a level below
    acquiring energy is the goal of finding a tool and then using it
    properly, which in turn entails the goal of approaching the
    potential food source. Levels above answer why; the levels below
    answer how. Depending on the task (breaking, prodding, or
    collecting), the stick can be held in various ways, including the
    precision grip (that is, between any two fingers but without the
    use of the palm). This illustrates an equifinality; chimps will
    diverge in the means but converge in the goal. To perform a
    precision grip requires specific hand biomechanics (e.g., thumbs
    that rotate around a joint). All Old World primates (and one New
    World monkey) can perform a precision grip; other animals
    cannot.</small>
  </P>
  <P>
    <small>Tool use also requires specialized neural circuitry
    operating in conjunction with those biomechanics in a
    goal-directed manner. The precision grip is correlated with
    extensive cortico-motoneuronal terminations in the ventral horn of
    the spinal cord, and motor planning and coordination are
    associated with neocortical areas 2 and 5, which are enlarged in
    tool-using primates. Finally, tool use is also a learned behavior;
    young chimpanzees learn by watching older chimpanzees combined
    with trial and error. Thus, tool use is a behavior bound to the
    body and brain circuits, and that emerges on evolutionary and
    developmental timescales."

	Behavior studied in animals whose bodies and worlds have been
	truncated can be misleading and not generalizable (the
	behavior of a paralytic cat in an empty arena is far from cat
	behavior).
      </li>
      <li>
	During development, animals undergo major changes not only in
	their behavior but also in their bodies. Despite our
	sequential measurements, behavior is generated
	serially. History matters.

      <ol type=A>
	<li>
	  The modern approach to understand behavior ‘‘cuts’’ but
	  fails to ‘‘stitch.’’ Wholes are taken to be the sum of their
	  parts, which in turn are considered replaceable. Context is
	  believed to be dispensable. Biology literally becomes
	  puzzle-solving; like in a Sudoku, our job is to fill in the
	  gaps or crack the circuit.
	</li>
	<li>
	  In opposition to (A), after cutting, one cannot really sew
	  life back the life of behavior, because context is
	  constitutive and thus inseparable from content. This tension
	  is illustrated in (C) and (D) with respect to space and in
	  (E) and (F) with respect to time.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Do not cut the body, as it is not a neural ‘‘plug-in’’ for
	  behavior. For instance, in chess, only algorithm matters,
	  and implementation is irrelevant. The hardware-software 
	  split (a form of crypto-dualism) easily endorses a
	  pseudo-materialism (indifference to matter). However, in
	  pool, the body is an inextricable part of the game. One can
	  never play the same pool game twice.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Do not cut the world. Even when the body is taken into
	  account, the same posture can reflect very different
	  behaviors. Leaving the world out literally leaves the body
	  floating in an empty space, disregarding the umwelt of the
	  animal. The meaning of the behavior is then lost.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Do not cut the loop. When our study of the organism in the
	  lab is framed under the ‘‘manipulate and measure’’ arc,
	  anthropomorphism has crept into the interpretation of
	  behavior before any data are even collected. The organism,
	  being an agent like the scientist, is also trying to measure
	  and manipulate. Thus, linear causality (so dear to us) is a
	  broken loop that cannot account for the circularity that
	  constitutes the behavior of organisms.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Do not cut the history. The restoration of initial
	  conditions is an abstraction inapplicable in biology. Living
	  organisms are individuals; they have their own history.
	  Treating them as indistinguishable particles smears out
	  their intrinsic differences and trumps not only
	  predictability but biological understanding.

  <h1>Gomez-Marin & Ghazanfar: the life of behavior (2019) — conclusions</h1>

  <P>
    "In stressing that animals operate under <B>circular
    causality</B>, one could be tempted to conclude that what we need
    to do is to map animals to machines. Behavior would then be an
    engineering problem. Such a view would not grant animals with
    purpose, however. The life of behavior is circular causality
    toward a goal.
  </P>
  <P>
    <font color=gray>William James made the distinction beautifully: ‘‘If now we pass
    from such actions as these to those of living things, we notice a
    striking difference. Romeo wants Juliet as the filings want the
    magnet; and if no obstacles intervene he moves towards her by as
    straight a line as they. But Romeo and Juliet, if a wall be built
    between them, do not remain idiotically pressing their faces
    against its opposite sides like the magnet and the filings with
    the card. Romeo soon finds a circuitous way, by scaling the wall
    or otherwise, of touching Juliet’s lips directly. With the filings
    the path is fixed; whether it reaches the end depends on
    accidents. With the lover it is the end which is fixed, the path
    may be modified indefinitely’’ (James, 1890, p.7)."</font>

    Walking one evening along a deserted road,
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasreddin" target=new>Mulla
      Nasruddin</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hajji"
      target=new>Hodja</a> saw a troop of horsemen rapidly
      approaching. His imagination started to work; he saw himself
      captured or robbed or killed and frightened by this thought he
      bolted, climbed a wall into a graveyard, and lay down in an open
      grave to hide. Puzzled at his bizzare behaviour, the horsemen –
      honest travellers – followed him. They found him stretched out,
      tense, and shaking. “What are you doing in that grave? We saw
      you run away. Can we help you? Why are you here in this place?”
      “Just because you can ask a question does not mean that there is
      a straightforward answer to it,” said Nasruddin, who now
      realized what had happened. “It all depends upon your
      viewpoint. If you must know, however, I am here because of you –
      and you are here because of me!”

  <h1>[EXTRA] an aside on "human wants" (recall Thurstone), free will, and the causes of
    things</h1>

  <P>
    From <I>Computing the Mind</I> (ch.10, p.464):
    <blockquote>
      FREE WILL is “a philosophical term of art for
      a particular sort of capacity of rational agents
      to choose a course of action from among various
      alternatives” (O’Connor, 2006). Upon
      a close examination, this seemingly simple
      concept disintegrates into a heap of contradictions,
      as noted by Voltaire: “Now you receive
      all your ideas; therefore you receive
      your wish, you wish therefore necessarily.
      [. . . ] The will, therefore, is not a faculty that
      one can call free. The free will is an expression
      absolutely devoid of sense, and what
      the scholastics have called will of indifference,
      that is to say willing without cause, is
      a chimera unworthy of being combated” (cf.
      Dennett, 1984, p. 143).
    </blockquote>
  </P>

  <P>
    Contrary to the popular misconception, <B>randomness is not a
      solution to the problem of reconciling free will with physics</B>: I
    want my decisions to be up to me—not blind chance or implacable fate.
    In the pursuit of free will, giving up determinism in favor of
    randomness is like inviting the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vandals"
    target=new>Vandals</a> into the city just to dispose of its
    tyrant.
