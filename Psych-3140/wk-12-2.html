  <h1>(a mathematical formalization of) the STDP rule</h1>

  <img src="STDP-fig2.png" height=300 title="STDP"

  <P>
    (If you're unfamiliar with the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_delta_function"

    equations, use the illustration and the boldface text below.)
  </P>
  <small>
  <P>
    Each presynaptic spike arrival leaves a trace \(x_j(t)\) which is updated by an
    amount \(a_{+}(x_j)\) at the moment of spike arrival and decays exponentially in
    the absence of spikes:
    $$
    \tau_{+}\frac{dx_j}{dt} = -x_j + a_{+}(x_j) \sum_f \delta\left(t -
    t_j^f\right)
    $$
    Similarly, each postsynaptic spike leaves a trace \(y\)
    $$
    \tau_{-}\frac{dy}{dt} = -y + a_{-} \sum_n \delta\left(t - t^n\right)
    $$
    which increases by \(a_{âˆ’}(y)\) at the moment of postsynaptic

    $$
    \frac{dw_j}{dt} = A_{+}\left(w_j\right) x\left(t\right) \sum_n

    <B>Thus, the weight is (1) increased at the moment of a
    postsynaptic spike by an amount that depends on the value of the
    trace \(x\) left by the presynaptic spike, and (2) decreased at
    the moment of presynaptic spike by an amount proportional to the

  <h1>STDP and Hebbian learning rules</h1>

  <P>
    STDP can be seen as a spike-based formulation of Hebbian learning:
    in a sense, it is "Hebb, done right".
  </P>
  <P>
    Hebb (1949) proposed that a synapse should be strengthened if a
    presynaptic neuron 'repeatedly or persistently takes part in
    firing' the postsynaptic one. This formulation suggests a
    potential <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/causation-process/"
    target=new><B>causal</B></a> relation between the firing of the
    two neurons. Causality requires that the presynaptic neuron fires
    slightly before the postsynaptic one. Hebb did not, however,
    postulate the existence of synaptic weakening. The anti-Hebbian
    (weakening) component is found in Oja and BCM rules.
  </P>

<DIV  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>STDP versus firing rate-based learning rules</h1>

  <P>
    Under the assumption of stationary
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution"
       target=new>Poisson statistics</a> for the firing times of pre-
       and postsynaptic neurons, the most relevant aspect of the STPD
       function from slide 5 is its integral and an STDP model can
       mapped to an equivalent rate-based learning rule.<sup>*</sup>
  </P>
  <P>
    Another point to note: for standard STDP models,
  <!--
  \(\beta>0\) , i.e., presynaptic spike arrival
  leads on average to a positive change  of the synapse, because it is
  likely to cause postsynaptic firing. This is  then often combined with a
  negative integral over the STDP function \(\alpha<0\) , so that
  -->
    random pairings of pre- and postsynaptic firings lead to a weakening
							of the
							synapse.
							</P>
  <HR width=30% align=left>
    <P>
      *<small>
      <font color=gray>
	Assuming independence between pre- and postsynaptic firing,
	  the total weight change is \(\Delta w_{ij} = \alpha f_i(t)
	  f_j(t)\) where \(f_j(t)\) and \(f_i(t)\) denote the firing
	  rate of pre- and postsynaptic neurons averaged over some
	  time \(T\) and \(\alpha = \int W(s)ds\) is the integral over
	  the learning window. If the integral is positive, STDP is
	  identical to standard rate-based Hebbian learning. For
	  negative integral, as often used in modeling, STDP
	  corresponds to a anti-Hebbian rate rule.
	<P>
	  However, the assumption of independence of pre- and
	  postsynaptic firing is obviously wrong: it neglects the
	  causal correlations generated by the interaction of the two
	  neurons. A more precise mapping to rate models can be
	  achieved if the postsynaptic neuron is described as an
	  inhomogeneous Poisson Process with a rate \(f_i(t) = \gamma
	  \sum_j \sum_f \epsilon(tâˆ’t^f_j)\) where \(t^f_j\) denotes
	  the spike times of a presynaptic neuron \(j\) generated by a
	  Poisson process of rate \(f_j(t)\) and \(\epsilon(s)\) for
	  \(s>0\) describes the time course of a postsynaptic
	  potential. The total weight change in a period \(T\) is then
	  \(\Delta w_{ij} = \alpha f_i(t)f_j(t) + \beta f_j(t)\) where
	  \(\beta = \gamma \int_{0}^{\infty} \epsilon(s)W(s)ds\) is
	  the integral over the 'causal' part of the learning window,
      i.e., over all times with 'pre-before-post' relation.

    STDP can also be related to a nonlinear rate model where the

    Unsupervised classification learning and sparsification of firing of output
    neurons after training. For testing we presented three examples from an
    independent test set of handwritten digits 0, 3, 4 from the
    <a href="http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/" target=new>MNIST dataset</a>,
    and compared the firing of the output-neurons before and after
    learning.

    <B>(B)</B> The implicit internal models created by the neurons after 2000
    training examples are revealed by presenting their learned weights as input
    templates. Clearly, neurons created separate internal models 
    for different ways of writing the two digits 0 and 3.

    <B>(C)</B> Re-organized internal models after 2000 further training
    examples that included digit 4. Two output neurons had created internal
    models for the newly introduced digit 4.

  <P class="incremental">
    When tested on sets of 10,000 new samples each, the network achieved a
    classification error of 2.19% on the digits 0 and 3 after 2000 training
    steps and 3.68% on all three digits after 4000 training steps.

    STDP does that on the level of individual synapses, by
    distinguishing pre-before-post from post-before-pre situations
    (unlike rate-based rules, such as Hebb, which are correlational).
  </P>
  <P>
    Ultimately, one must determine which world events cause other
    events. Note that this undertaking â€” model-based reinforcement
    learning â€” must also be implemented with STDP and eligibility
    trace mechanisms, because that is all that the brain has at its
    disposal.
