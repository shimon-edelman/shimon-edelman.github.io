  <P>
  Three hypotheses regarding cell assemblies:
  <ol>
    <li>
      Cell assemblies are best understood in light of their output, as
      detected by "reader-actuator" mechanisms.
    </li>
    <li>
      The hierarchical organization of cell assemblies may be regarded
      as a
      neural <font color=red>"</font>syntax<font color=red>"</font>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Constituents of the neural syntax are linked together by
      dynamically changing constellations of synaptic weights
      (ensembles of synapses, or "synapsembles").
    </li>
  </ol>
  </P>
  <HR>
    <P class="incremental">
      [EXTRA: Note that the representations implemented by synapsembles are
      <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/DualGraph.html" target=new>DUAL</a> to those
      implemented by neural activities.]

  <P>
    <B>(A)</B> Hebb's reverberating cell assembly sequences ("assembly
    phases"). Arrows represent transitions between individual
    assemblies, numbered sequentially in order. <small>The direction
    of activity flow across assemblies (edges) is determined by the
    stronger synaptic strengths among assembly members relative to
    other connections (not shown). The same assembly can participate
    in a sequence more than once (e.g., pathway 1, 4 indicates
    recurring transitions). <!-- No mechanism is postulated to explain why
    activity does not spread to all parts of the network and
    reverberate forever.--> </small>
  </P>
  <P>
    <B>(B)</B> Top: long sequence of two characters (e.g., dot and
    dash). Its embedded information is virtually impossible to
    recover. Bottom: same exact sequence as above after adding
    syntactic segmentation (space = stop-start punctuation) between
    the short strings of
    characters. <small>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code"
    target=new><B>Morse code</B></a> message reads: "segmentation of
    information is essence of coding." By analogy, segmentation or
    "chunking" of neuronal assemblies can be brought about by salient
    external stimulus sequences, brain-initiated, modality-specific
    synchronizing-blanking mechanisms (such as saccadic eye movement,
    sniffing, whisking, active touch, licking, contraction of middle
    ear muscles, etc.), internally generated oscillations, or other
      syntactical mechanisms.</small>

  <h1>reader-defined cell assemblies</h1>

  <img src="Buzsaki10-fig1c.png" class="figure-right" >
  <P>
  <B>(C)</B> Neurons that fire within the <B>integrating window</B> of a reader
  mechanism (corresponding, e.g., to the ability of a reader neuron to integrate
  its inputs within the time frame of its membrane time constant) define an assembly
  (irrespective of whether or not assembly members are interconnected
  synaptically among themselves). Readers <B>a</B>, <B>b</B>, <B>c</B> ,and
 <B>w</B> may receive inputs from many  
  neurons (1 to n) by way of synapses differing in strength but respond only to
  a combination of spiking neurons to which they are most strongly connected
  (e.g., reader <B>a</B> responds preferentially to cofiring of neurons 1, 5, and 9 at \(t_1\),
  even though it may be synaptically innervated by neurons 2, 6, and 10 as
  well; at \(t_2\), neuron <B>b</B> fires in response to the discharge of neurons 2, 6, and
 10).
  <P>
    <small>Synaptic strengths between neurons vary as a function of the spiking
  history of both postsynaptic and presynaptic neuron
  (short-term <B>plasticity</B>, to be discussed
  <a href="wk-12-1.html"
  target=n>next week</a>).
  The response of the reader neuron, therefore, depends on both the identity
  of the spiking upstream neurons and the constellation of current synaptic
  weights ("synapsembles"). Reader mechanism <B>q</B> has a longer time integrator
  and, therefore, can link together assemblies to neural "words," reading out
  a new quality not present in the individual representations of <B>a</B>, <B>b</B>, and
  <B>c</B>.</small>
