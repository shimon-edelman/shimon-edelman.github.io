  <h1>(II) what language BEHAVIOR is like [what does this remind you of?]</h1>

  <P>
    The problem of serial order in behavior, as formulated by Lashley
    (1951), contains, upon reflection, two complementary aspects: 
    
    <ul>
      <li>The STRUCTURAL or SYNCHRONIC aspect: how to deal with
	multiple input and/or output variables, specified at a given
	instant of time.  Hence the computational problem
	of <B>multimodality</B>: embodied agents must 
	deal with multiple streams of information (multiple sensors &
	actuators), which, moreover, may differ radically in their
	statistical and other properties (e.g., auditory vs. visual
	cues).
      </li>
      <li>
	The TEMPORAL or DIACHRONIC aspect: how to deal with multiple
	streams of information as they unfold over time.  Hence the
	computational problem of 
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(computer_science)"
	target=new><B>concurrency</B></a>: 
	the dynamical processes that affect / comprise
	behavior not only unfold in parallel: they generally do so at
	different rates and independently, or asynchronously, with
	regard to each other.
