    <li>
    Third, that constituents of the neural syntax are linked together by

    (ensembles of synapses, or "synapsembles").

  <h1>cell assemblies and the problem of segmentation</h1>

  <img src="Buzsaki10-fig1ab.png" class="figure-right" >
  <P>
  <BR>
  <B>(A)</B> Hebb's reverberating cell assembly sequences ("assembly
  phases"). <small>Arrows represent transitions between individual assemblies. The
  direction of activity flow across assemblies (edges) is determined by the
  stronger synaptic strengths among assembly members relative to other
  connections (not shown). The same assembly can participate in a sequence
  more than once (e.g., pathway 1, 4 indicates recurring transitions). No
  mechanism is postulated to explain why activity does not spread to all
  parts of the network and reverberate forever.</small>
  <P>
  <B>(B)</B> Top: long sequence of two characters (e.g., dot and dash). Its
  embedded information is virtually impossible to recover. Bottom: same
  exact sequence as above after adding syntactic segmentation (space =
  stop-start punctuation) between the short strings of
  characters. <small>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code"
  target=new><B>Morse code</B></a> message reads: "segmentation of 
  information is essence of coding." By analogy, segmentation or "chunking"
  of neuronal assemblies can be brought about by salient external stimulus
  sequences, brain-initiated, modality-specific synchronizing-blanking
  mechanisms (such as saccadic eye movement, sniffing, whisking, active
  touch, licking, contraction of middle ear muscles, etc.), internally
  generated oscillations, or other syntactical mechanisms.</small>

  <h1>reader-defined cell assemblies</h1>

  <img src="Buzsaki10-fig1c.png" class="figure-right" >
  <P>
  <BR>
  <B>(C)</B> Neurons that fire within the <B>integrating window</B> of a reader
  mechanism (corresponding, e.g., to the ability of a reader neuron to integrate
  its inputs within the time frame of its membrane time constant) define an assembly
  (irrespective of whether or not assembly members are interconnected
  synaptically among themselves). Readers <B>a</B>, <B>b</B>, <B>c</B> ,and
 <B>w</B> may receive inputs from many  
  neurons (1 to n) by way of synapses differing in strength but respond only to
  a combination of spiking neurons to which they are most strongly connected
  (e.g., reader <B>a</B> responds preferentially to cofiring of neurons 1, 5, and 9 at \(t_1\),
  even though it may be synaptically innervated by neurons 2, 6, and 10 as
  well; at \(t_2\), neuron <B>b</B> fires in response to the discharge of neurons 2, 6, and
  10). <small>Synaptic strengths between neurons vary as a function of the spiking
  history of both postsynaptic and presynaptic neuron (short-term <B>plasticity</B>).
  The response of the reader neuron, therefore, depends on both the identity
  of the spiking upstream neurons and the constellation of current synaptic
  weights ("synapsembles"). Reader mechanism <B>q</B> has a longer time integrator
  and, therefore, can link together assemblies to neural "words," reading out
  a new quality not present in the individual representations of <B>a</B>, <B>b</B>, and
  <B>c</B>.</small>

  <B>(A)</B> Wiring diagram of the early olfactory system of the locust. An

  <B>(B)</B> Firing patterns of 3 AL neurons (PN1-3) in response to 16
  different odors. The activity of AL neurons defines the "population
  vector" or "state" of the network; the time-varying population vector

  a few hundred milliseconds before relaxing back to baseline (illustrated
  by the curve in the inset in A).
