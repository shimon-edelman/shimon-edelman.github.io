    Intelligence test scores and educational duration are positively

    Students with greater propensity for intelligence go on to
    complete more education, or a longer education increases
    intelligence.

      <li>

    and the legitimation of the social division of labor</I></a>,
    Berkeley Journal of Sociology, 20:233-264 
    (1975-76).
    <blockquote>
      "A major proposition of Marxian educational theory is that the
      educational system in advanced capitalist societies is a
      mechanism for the reproduction of the social division of labor.
      This paper deals with one aspect of the reproduction process:
      the <I>legitimation</I> of the division of labor and the process
      of assigning individuals to its various positions. We say that a
      social process is legitimated when individuals are sufficiently
      convinced of its inevitability, desirability, or justness that
      united class action towards the transformation of the process is
      rendered infeasible. Thus the apparent legitimacy of social
      relationships is one, but clearly not the only, basis of the
      fragmentation of class solidarity."
