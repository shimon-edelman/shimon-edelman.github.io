<h2>How people learn from sparse data (from Tenenbaum et al., 2011)</h2>

<P>
  In concept learning, the data might correspond to several example
  objects and the hypotheses to possible extensions of the
  concept. Why, given three examples of different kinds of horses,
  would a child generalize the word “horse” to all and only horses
  (h1)?
</p>

<ul>
  <li>(h1) "horses"</li>
  <li>(h2) "all horses except Clydesdales"</li>
  <li>(h3) "all animals"</li>
  <li>...</li>
</ul>

<P>
  Why not h2, “all horses except Clydesdales”; h3, “all animals”; or
  any other rule consistent with the data?
</P>

<P>
  LIKELIHOODS favor the more specific patterns, h1 and h2; <B>it would
  be a highly <I>suspicious coincidence</I><sup>*</sup> to draw three
  random examples that all fall within the smaller sets h1 or h2 if
  they were actually drawn from the much larger h3</B>.
</P>

<P>
  The PRIOR favors h1 and h3, because as more
  coherent and distinctive categories, they are more likely to be the
  referents of common words in language.
</P>

<P>
  Only h1 scores highly on both terms.
</P>

<P>
  Likewise, in causal learning, the data could be co-occurences
  between events; the hypotheses, possible causal relations linking
  the events. Likelihoods favor causal links that make the
  co-occurence more probable, whereas priors favor links that fit with
  our background knowledge of what kinds of events are likely to cause
  which others; for example, a disease (e.g., cold) is more likely to
  cause a symptom (e.g., coughing) than the other way around.

<sup>*</sup>The principle of suspicious coincidence, formulated by
 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horace_Barlow"
 target=new>Horace Barlow</a> (1956; 1990) states that the
 cooccurrence of two events, A and B, should be deemed "suspicious"
 (deserving scrutiny) if its probability, P(A&B), is significantly
 larger than the product of the marginals P(A)P(B).
