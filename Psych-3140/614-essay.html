<h1>Psych 6140 essay</h1>

Write between 1000 and 3000 words, aiming to pull together one or more of
 the conceptual threads &#151; neural computation, hierarchical abstraction,
 statistical inference, etc. &#151; that run through the material covered by
 the book, the lectures, and the supplementary readings.
<P>
You may structure your write-up as an article in the science section of the
 New York Times, a feature in the New Yorker, a Scientific American article,
 a book review (which does <B>not</B> have to be positive, but must be
 well-argued and well-supported by references), an introduction to a book
 (which may be real or imaginary), an epic poem in true or alliterative
 verse (no free verse, please), or in any other manner that you may choose.
<P>
It would probably be a good idea for you to talk to me (during office hours)
 before starting to write.
