  <h1>decision making in "cognition" vs. perception/action</h1>

  <P>
  <BR>
  The distinctions among sensorimotor, perceptual, and cognitive components
  of the task are blurred.
  <P>
  However:
  <ul class="incremental">
    <li>
    In many explicit cognitive tasks, people make suboptimal judgments when
    faced with a set of decisions with uncertain outcomes.
    </li>
    <P>
    <li>
    By contrast, when confronted with the motor variants of the same tasks,
    people often exhibit close to optimal decisions (as the next slide
    illustrates). 
    </li>
  </ul>

<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>an example from game theory: the Prisoner's Dilemma</h1>

  <img src="prisoners_dilemma.jpg" height=350 class="figure-right">
  <P>
  <BR>
  Closing the sensorimotor loop between two people also allows an
  examination of strategy in tasks that are either combative or
  cooperative. Such decision making is typically examined within the
  framework of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory" target=new>game theory</a>.
  <P>
  For example, in classical <a
 href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma"
   target=new>Prisoner's Dilemma</a> (see also <a
 href="https://xkcd.com/1016/" target=new>St. Valentine's Day Dilemma</a>),
  two prisoners each choose to cooperate (claim the other person is
  innocent) or defect (claim the other person is guilty). If both cooperate,
  they each receive a short sentence (1 years), whereas if both 
  defect they each receive a moderate sentence (5 years), and if one
  cooperates and the other defects, the defector is freed and the cooperator
  receives a lengthy sentence (20 years).
  <P>
  The globally optimal solution in which the players benefit the most is for
  both players to cooperate. However, if one of the players decides to
  defect, the defector reduces their sentence at the expense of the other
  player. In such a non-cooperative setting, the Nash solution, which
  minimizes each player's maximum possible punishment, is for both players
  to defect. When people have to make decisions based on a set of rules 
  such as these, they are typically sub-optimal â€” but not if it's a motor task!

  <B>(a)</B>
  A motor version of the <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma"
  target=new>Prisoner's Dilemma</a> game. Each player makes a 
  reaching movement from a starting position to a target bar and can choose
  any path between the bars. A robot simulates a stiff spring that resists
  the subjects' movements. The spring constant for each subject depends on
  the lateral position of both players. The lateral position of each
  subject's hand is mapped from "fully cooperate" at one extreme to "fully
  defect" at the other.
  <P>
  <B>(b)</B>
  The spring constant for each player matches the typical prisoner's dilemma
  payoff at the extremes and is linearly interpolated between these
  extremes. 
  <P>
  <B>(c)</B> 
  When a single subject controls both robots with their two arms (not shown)
  the dominant strategy is cooperative, whereas in the two-player game the

  solutions in which they choose actions so that neither has anything to

  <h1>classes of control</h1>

  <img src="Koerding-TiCS06-fig3.png" class="figure-right">
  <P>
  In general, optimizing motor performance is achieved through
  three classes of control:
  <ul>
    <li>
    <B>reactive</B> or <B>feedback</B> control, which involves the use of
    sensory inputs to update ongoing motor commands; and
    </li>
    <li>
    <B>predictive</B> or <B>feedforward</B> control, which is critical given the
    feedback delays in the sensorimotor system;
    </li>
    <li>
    <B>biomechanical</B> control, which involves modulating the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiffness#Compliance" target=new>compliance</a> of the limb.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <HR>
  <small>
  The Bayesian framework has many uses in sensorimotor learning. <B>Sensory
  integration.</B> Multiple streams of sensory information, within and across
  modalities (for example, visual and tactile inputs), can be optimally
  combined to achieve estimates that reduce the effects of noise. This
  integration process can take into account the properties of external
  objects, such as tools, so that the visuo-haptic integration is optimal
  even when the tactile input comes through a hand-held tool. <B>Learning
  priors.</B> By learning the statistical distribution of possible states of
  the world, the estimate can be further refined. <B>Developing and using
  internal models.</B> By combining these processes with internal models of
  the body that map the motor commands (as signalled through the efference
  copy) into the expected sensory inputs, Bayesian inference can be used to
  estimate the evolving state of our body and the world.</small>

  <h1>minimum-intervention control</h1>

  <img src="finger-control-muscles.jpg" class="figure-right">
  <P>
  <BR>
  Feedback controllers must only correct for variation that is deleterious
  to the task goal. Corrections of task-irrelevant errors are not only
  wasteful but they can also generate task-relevant errors.
  <P>
  This <B>minimum intervention principle</B> has now been demonstrated in a number
  of tasks including the seemingly simple task of generating a target force
  with the tip of the index finger. The control of this task can be
  characterized within a 7-dimensional space representing the seven
  muscles that regulate index finger force. The variability in this space can
  be partitioned into a <I>task-relevant component</I> that modulates force in the
  target direction and a <I>task-irrelevant component</I> that does not. During
  this task, task-irrelevant variability is consistently larger than
  task-relevant variability, suggesting that at the muscle level there is a
  preferential control of task-relevant dimensions.

    <li>For error-based learning to occur, the system needs to apportion the

  <h1>representations (models) in reinforcement learning</h1>

  <P>
  Information obtained during a single movement is often too
  sparse or too noisy to unambiguously determine the source of the
  error. Therefore, it underspecifies the way in which the
  motor commands should be updated, resulting in an  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_problem"
  target=new>INVERSE PROBLEM</a> (differences in control uniquely specify
  differences in outcome, but not vice versa).
  <P>
  To resolve this issue, the system uses <B>models</B> of the task:
  representations that reflect its ASSUMPTIONS about the task
  structure and that constrain error-driven learning. Such models can
  be mechanistic or normative. 
  <P>
  <B>Mechanistic models</B> specify the representations and learning
  algorithms directly. In this framework, representations are often
  considered to be based on motor primitives (the neural building blocks out
  of which new motor memories are formed; cf. synergies illustrated in
 slides 9â€”11).
  <P>
  <B>Normative models</B> specify optimal ways for the learner to adapt when 
  faced with errors. A normative model includes two key components:
  <ol>
    <li>a GENERATIVE MODEL of the situation, which specifies how different
    factors, such as tools or levels of fatigue, influence performance;

    <li>a prior distribution, which states how these factors are likely to

  <B>Motor primitives</B> can be thought of as neural control modules that can be

  \(S_i\) is defined by the averaged future reward \(\tilde{R}\) which can

  <h1>EXTRA: goal-directed decision making â€” a kind of inverse inference (Solway & Botvinick, 2012)</h1>

  <P>
  <BR>
  Goal-directed decision making, like so many other forms of human and
  animal information processing, can be fruitfully understood in terms of
  probabilistic inference. In particular, we [Solway & Botvinick 2012]
  propose that goal-directed decisions arise out of an internal generative
  model, which captures how situations, plans, actions, and outcomes
  interact to generate reward. Decision making, as we characterize it,
  involves <B>inverse</B> inference within this generative model: The decision
  process takes the occurrence of reward as a premise and leverages the
  generative model to determine which course of action best explains the
  observation of reward.
  <P>
  Goal-directed decision making can be viewed as a version of model-based
  reinforcement learning. The "model" referred to in this term comes in two
  parts: a state-transition function, which maps from situation-action pairs
  to outcomes, and a reward function, which attaches a reward value to each
  world state. Model-based reinforcement learning refers to the project of
  discovering an optimal (reward-maximizing) policy, or mapping from states
  to actions, given this two-part model.

  <h1>reframing the computational problem</h1>

  <P>
  <BR>
  Model-based reinforcement learning begins with a set of givens, which
  include a set of states, \(S\); a set of actions, \(A\); a
  state-transition function \(T\left(s\in S, a\in A, s^{\prime}\in
  S\right)\), which specifies the probability of arriving in state
  \(s^{\prime}\) after having performed action \(a\) in state \(s\); and 
  a reward function \(R(s)\), which assigns a scalar reward value to each
  state. The computational problem is then to choose a policy
  \(\pi(s,a,t) = p(a\mid s,t)\) that maximizes expected cumulative reward
  over steps of action \(t\) up to some planning horizon \(T\):
  $$
  argmax_{\pi} E\left[\sum_{t=1}^{T} p_t\left(s\mid\pi\right)
  R\left(s\right)\right]
  $$
  Our objective is to reframe this problem in terms of probabilistic
  inference.

  the architecture in this way, we also introduce one final new element: a
  variable representing the cumulative reward accrued over an action
 sequence \(\hat{R}_c\).

  <h1>a generative model for reward</h1>

  <img src="SolwayBotvinick12-fig2.png" class="figure-right">
  <P>
  <BR>
  In the conventional case, where reward is represented as an ordinary real
  number (which we shall continue to denote by \(r\)), the problem is to
  find the policy that maximizes expected reward magnitude.
  <P>
  In contrast, in the scenario we are considering, the problem is instead to
  maximize the probability of a discrete event, \(p\left(\hat{r} = 1 \mid
  \pi\right)\). Goal-directed decision making thus becomes a
  likelihood maximization problem. This seemingly incidental point has
  far-reaching ramifications, which we unpack in what follows.

  <h1>a generative model for reward</h1>

  <img src="SolwayBotvinick12-fig3.png" class="figure-right">
  <P>
  <BR>
  <B>The graphical model can be seen as simply one way of representing the
  standard ingredients of a model-based reinforcement learning
  problem. However, another way of viewing it is as a generative model for
  reward.</B> That is, the model represents the interrelated factors â€” initial states, policies,
  actions, and outcomes â€” that together give rise to reward events.
  To illustrate, we can "query" the variable \(\hat{R}\) , asking for the 
  marginal probability \(p\left(\hat{r}\mid s\right)\). In the one-step
  model, this probability depends on the remaining variables as
  follows:
  $$
  p\left(\hat{r}\mid s\right) = \sum_{s^{\prime},a,\pi} p\left(\hat{r}\mid
  s^{\prime}\right) p\left(s^{\prime}\mid s,a\right) p\left(a\mid
  s,\pi\right) p\left(\pi\right)
  $$
  <small>
  Note that the first factor in this sum is simply the reward
  function. The second term is the transition function, and the
  third expresses the effect of policies on action selection. The
  final term represents the decision maker's prior bias toward
  specific policies, expressed as a probability distribution. Each
  of these factors corresponds to the conditional probability distribution
  (CPD) at a specific node in the graph.

  <h1>conditional inference</h1>

  <img src="SolwayBotvinick12-fig3.png" class="figure-right">
  <P>
  <BR>
  Probabilistic graphical models provide a substrate for conditional
  inference. Given an observed or known value for one or more variables, one
  can query the conditional distribution for any other set of variables. We
  saw an illustration of this on the previous slide, where the value of the
  initial state \(s\) was an observed quantity. The same approach could be
  used to obtain the marginal probability of \(p\left(\hat{r}=1\right)\),
  given a commitment to a specific policy. This is obtained by treating
  \(\Pi\) as an observed variable (\(\Pi =\pi\); see top figure), and
  computing
  $$
  p\left(\hat{r}\mid s,\pi\right) = \sum_{s^{\prime},a} p\left(\hat{r}\mid
  s^{\prime}\right) p\left(s^{\prime}\mid s,a\right) p\left(a\mid
  s,\pi\right) 
  $$
  Conditioning on a policy and querying the reward variable in this way
  offers one potential method for solving the computational problem we have
  laid out. The decision maker could iterate through all available policies,
  keeping a record of the expected reward for each, and then choose the
  policy that maximizes that quantity. However, there is also another, more
  interesting route to solving the computational problem.

  <h1>abductive inference</h1>

  <img src="SolwayBotvinick12-fig3.png" class="figure-right">
  <P>
  <BR>
  Rather than conditioning on policies and computing rewards,
  it is possible to invert the model to reason from
  rewards to policies (bottom figure). Specifically, leveraging
  our binary representation of reward, we can condition on \(\hat{r} = 1\)
  and apply Bayes' law to compute
  $$
  p\left(\pi\mid s,\hat{r}\right) ~ \propto ~ \sum_{s^{\prime},a}
  p\left(\hat{r}\mid s^{\prime}\right) p\left(s^{\prime}\mid s,a\right)
  p\left(a\mid s,\pi\right) p\left(\pi\right)
  $$
  If there is no initial bias toward any specific policy
  (uniform priors \(p(\pi)\)), then

  -- right-hand side of Equation 5 is identical to that of Equation
  4. That is, --
  
  \(p\left(\pi\mid s,\hat{r}\right) = p\left(\hat{r}\mid s,\pi\right)\).
  This suggests an alternative way of framing the computational
  problem involved in goal-directed decision making. According to
  our earlier formulation, the objective was to find a policy to
  maximize \(p(\hat{r}\mid \pi)\). It is now evident that an equally valid
  objective is to find a policy to maximize
  \(p(\pi\mid\hat{r})\). Conditioning on \(\hat{r}=1\), the 
  task is to identify the policy that best explains that "observation."
  This is <B>policy abduction</B>: it involves reasoning from effects
  (reward) to their explanations or causes (policies for action).
