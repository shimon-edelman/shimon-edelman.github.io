    Goats are a species that is projected to adapt better to the
    negative consequences of climate change. They withstand the
    potential repercussions of climate change better than other farm
    animals due to their specific features. Another advantage is that
    landless small-scale farmers in rural regions prefer goats as a
    guaranteed higher production system with little infrastructure and
    effort. While the future is fraught with unexpected climatic
    pressures, managing resilience and adaptation strategies based on
    goat breeding can reduce the vulnerability of rural households to
    their livelihoods. Even in the worst-case scenario, goat farming
    will be ecologically friendly and cost-effective in meeting the
    expanding population's animal protein demands. <B>In conclusion,
    goats are an appropriate climate-resilient model for future animal
    production activities</B> because of their improved drought and
    thermo-tolerance, unique eating behavior, capacity to thrive on
    limited pasture, improved feed conversion efficiency, high
    resistance to disease and internal and external parasites,
    potential to emit less methane and minimal investment in goat
    farming.

  <h1>[Tolman's concluding remarks from that paper]</h1>

  "Narrow strip maps rather than broad comprehensive maps seem to be
  induced: (1) by a damaged brain, (2) by an inadequate array of
  environmentally presented cues, (3) by an overdose of repetitions on the
  original trained-on path and (4) by the presence of too strongly
  motivational or of too strongly frustrating conditions.<BR>
  <small>
  Over and over again men are blinded by too violent motivations and too
  intense frustrations into blind and unintelligent and in the end
  desperately dangerous hates of outsiders. And the expression of these their
  displaced hates ranges all the way from discrimination against minorities
  to world conflagrations.
  <BR>
  What is the name of Heaven and Psychology can we do about it? My only
  answer is to preach again the virtues of reason — of, that is, broad
  cognitive maps. And to suggest that the child-trainers and the
  world-planners of the future can only, if at all, bring about the presence
  of the required rationality (i.e., comprehensive maps) if they see to it
  that nobody's children are too over-motivated or too frustrated. Only then
  can these children learn to look before and after, learn to see that there
  are often round-about and safer paths to their quite proper goals — learn,
  that is, to realize that the well-beings of White and of Negro, of Catholic
  and of Protestant, of Christian and of Jew, of American and of Russian (and
  even of males and females) are mutually interdependent. 
  <BR>
  We dare not let ourselves or others become so over-emotional, so hungry,
  so ill-clad, so over-motivated that only narrow strip-maps will be
  developed. All of us in Europe as well as in America, in the Orient as well
  as in the Occident, must be made calm enough and well-fed enough to be able
  to develop truly comprehensive maps [...].
  <BR>
  We must, in short, subject our children and ourselves (as the kindly
  experimenter would his rats) to the optimal conditions of moderate
  motivation and of an absence of unnecessary frustrations, whenever we put
  them and ourselves before that great God-given maze which is our human
  world. I cannot predict whether or not we will be able, or be allowed, to
  do this; but I <I>can</I> say that, only insofar as we <I>are</I> able and are allowed,
  have we cause for hope."

      (D) [The model's] task is predicting the next sensory
      observation in sequences derived from probabilistic transitions
      on a graph. Each node has an arbitrary sensory experience, e.g.,
      a banana. An agent transitions on the graph observing only the
      immediate sensory stimuli and associated action taken, e.g.,
      having seen motorbike/book/table/chair, it should predict the
      motorbike next if it understands the rules of the graph.

    <P>
      (E) If you know the underlying structure of social hierarchies,
      observing a new node (in red) via a single relationship, e.g.,
