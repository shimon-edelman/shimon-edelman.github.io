  Four case studies — four approaches to understanding the brain, and their limitations:
  <ol>
    <li>
    An ambitious broad-scope "computational" theory (ACT-R): based on a
    single top-down assumption <I>about the solution/mechanism</I> —
    not about any of the problems that arise.
    </li>
    <li>
    A single-cell electrophysiology study (microstimulation): neat, but
    leaves most questions unresolved.
    </li>
    <li>
    An imaging study (fMRI): trying to pinpoint where in the brain
    particular operations happen is not only not informative; localization
    of function is a fool's hope, even if we're confident about what
    the function is.
    </li>
    <li>
    Throwing machine learning at problems (Deep Learning etc.): even
    if the hack succeeds, it doesn't reveal much about how the brain
    works, or how to scale apps up.
