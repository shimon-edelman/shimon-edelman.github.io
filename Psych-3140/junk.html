  עולם מלא; <B>וכל המקיים נפש אחת, מעלים עליו כאילו קיים עולם מלא.</B> [...]  להגיד
  גדולתו של מלך מלכי המלכים, הקדוש ברוך הוא, שאדם טובע מאה מטבעות בחותם אחד,
  וכולן דומין זה לזה, מלך מלכי המלכים הקדוש ברוך הוא טובע את כל האדם בחותמו
  של אדם הראשון, ואין אחד מהם דומה לחברו.  לפיכך לכל אחד ואחד לומר, בשבילי
  נברא העולם.

  For this reason man was created one and alone in the world: to
  teach that whosoever destroys a single soul is regarded as though he
  destroyed a complete world, and <B>whosoever saves a single soul is regarded
  as though he saved a complete world</B>; [...] Also to proclaim the greatness of the King of
  kings of kings, blessed be He! for mankind stamps a hundred coins with one
  seal, and they are all alike, but the King of kings of kings, blessed be
  He! has stamped every man with the seal of the first Adam, and not one of 
  them is like his fellow. So every single person is forced to say, The
  world was created for my sake.
