Aspalathus, a plant mentioned in Pliny the Elder's Natural History,
Dioscorides' De Materia Medica, Theophrastus' Enquiry into Plants, and
Ecclesiasticus is most probably caper (Capparis sp.). It has an
Akkadian linguistic cognate, supalu. Ethnobotanical, archaeobotanical,
and linguistic evidence show that this plant has played a role in the
ancient, but ongoing cultural tradition in the Near East.

In the same region [Cyprus] grows camel's thorn [aspalathos], a white
thorn of the size of a moderate-sized tree, with the flower of a rose;
the root is in request for unguents. People say that any shrub over
which a rainbow forms its arch gives out a scent as sweet as that of
the aspalathus, but that if this happens in the case of an aspalathus
a scent rises that is indescribably sweet. Some call this shrub red
scepter [erysisceptrum] and others scepter. The test of its
genuineness lies in its fiery red colour, firmness to the touch and
scent like that of beaver-oil. It is sold for 5 denarii a pound
(Pliny, Nat. Hist. 12.52.10).

Aspalathus, some call Erysisceptron [i.e., red scepter]. It is a woody
kind of shrub having many prickly thornes, growing in Istrus, and
Nisyrus, and Syria, and Rhodes, which the ointment-makers use for the
thickening of their ointments. That is good which is heauie, and after
it is barked about, enclining to a red or a purple colour, thick,
odoriferous, and bitter in the taste (Dioscorides, De Materia Medica
1, 19).

I gave a sweet smell like cinnamon and aspalathus, and I yielded a
pleasant odour like the best myrrh, as galbanum, and onyx, and sweet
storax, and as the fume of frankincense in the tabernacle
(Ecclesiasticus 24:15).

Now this is a general list of the plants used for perfumes: cassia
cinnamon cardamom spikenard nairon balsam of Mecca aspalathos storax
iris narte kostos all-heal saffron-crocus myrrh kypeiron ginger-grass
sweet-flag sweet marjoram lotos dill. Of these it is the roots, bark,
branches, wood, seeds, gum or flowers which in different cases yield
the perfume. Some of them grow in many places, but the most excellent
and most fragrant all come from Asia and sunny regions. From Europe
itself comes none of them except the iris (Theophrastus, Enquiry into
Plants 9.7.3).
