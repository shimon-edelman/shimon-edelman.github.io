<H2>A circular trail in the Judean Desert</H2>

<P>This hike in Nachal (<A HREF="defs.html#arroyo">wadi, arroyo</A>)
Arugot follows one of the classic trails in the Judean Desert. It
starts near Kibbutz Ein-Gedi, near the Dead Sea shore, climbs about
500m to the level of the desert plateau above, descends back into the
Nachal near the great pools formed in the rock by the running water,
and brings you back to the Kibbutz about 8 hours later, wishing to be
able to start it all over again.


<P>I will be adding more information (and pictures!) to this tale,
whenever I have the time. Meanwhile, <A HREF="pics.html#pic1"
TARGET=picframe>enjoy</A> the virtual hike.
