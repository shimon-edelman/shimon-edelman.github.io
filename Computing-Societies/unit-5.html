  <h1>ABM in social sciences [Axelrod & Tesfatsion]</h1>

  <P>
  <BR>
  The social sciences seek to understand not only how individuals
  behave but also how the interaction of many individuals leads to
  large-scale outcomes. Understanding a political or economic system
  requires more than an understanding of the individuals that comprise
  the system. It also requires understanding how the individuals
  interact with each other, and how the results can be <I>more than the
  sum of the parts</I>.
  <P>
    ABM is well suited for this social science objective. It is a
    method for studying systems exhibiting the following two
    properties:
    <ol>
      <li>
	the system is composed of interacting agents; and
      </li>
      <li>
	the system exhibits emergent properties, that is, properties
    arising from the interactions of the agents that cannot be deduced
	simply by aggregating the properties of the agents.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <P>
      When the interaction of the agents is contingent on past
      experience (recall the concept of
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_dependence"
      target=new>path / history dependence</a>), and especially when
      the agents continually adapt to that experience, mathematical
      analysis is typically very limited in its ability to derive the
      dynamic consequences. <I>In this case, ABM might be the only
      practical method of analysis</I>.
    </P>

<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>the place of simulation in science</h1>

  <P>
  <BR>
  ABM begins with assumptions about agents and their interactions and
  then uses computer simulation to generate “histories” that can
  reveal the dynamic consequences of these assumptions. Thus, ABM
  researchers can investigate how large-scale effects arise from the
  micro-processes of interactions among many agents. These agents can
  represent people (say consumers, sellers, or voters), but they can
  also represent social groupings such as families, firms,
  communities, government agencies and nations.
  <P>
    Simulation in general, and ABM in particular, is a third way of
    doing science in addition to
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning"
    target=new>deduction</a> and
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning"
    target=new>induction</a>. Scientists use deduction to derive
    theorems from assumptions, and induction to find patterns in
    empirical data. Simulation, like deduction, starts with a set of
    explicit assumptions. But unlike deduction, simulation does not
    prove theorems with generality. Instead, simulation generates data
    suitable for analysis by induction. Nevertheless, unlike typical
    induction, the simulated data come from a rigorously specified set
    of assumptions regarding an actual or proposed system of interest
    rather than direct measurements of the real world. Consequently,
    simulation differs from standard deduction and induction in both
    its implementation and its goals. Simulation permits increased
    understanding of systems through controlled computational
    experiments.

  <h1>the four goals of ABM</h1>

      <ol>
	<li>
	  <I>Empirical understanding.</I> Why have particular
	  large-scale regularities evolved and persisted, even when
	  there is little top-down control? (Examples: standing
	  ovations, trade networks, socially accepted monies, mutual
	  cooperation based on reciprocity, and social norms.) ABM
	  researchers
	  seek <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"
	  target=new>CAUSAL EXPLANATIONS</a> grounded in the repeated
	  interactions of agents operating in specified
	  environments. In particular, they ask whether particular
	  types of observed global regularities can be reliably
	  generated from particular types of agent-based models.
	</li>
	<li>
	  <I>Normative understanding.</I> How can agent-based models
	  be used as laboratories for the discovery of good designs?
	  Will designs proposed for social policies, institutions, or
	  processes result in socially desirable system performance
	  over time? (Examples: design of auction systems, voting
	  rules, and law enforcement.) The general approach is like
	  filling a bucket with water to determine if it leaks. An
	  agent-based world is constructed that captures the salient
	  aspects of a social system operating under the design. The
	  world is then populated with privately motivated agents with
	  learning capabilities and allowed to develop over time. The
	  key issue is the extent to which the resulting world
	  outcomes are efficient, fair, and orderly, despite attempts
	  by these privately motivated agents to gain individual
	  advantage through strategic behavior.

      </ol>

<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>the four goals of ABM (cont.)</h1>

  <ol start=3>
    <li>
      <I>Heuristic.</I> How can greater insight be attained about the
      fundamental causal mechanisms in social systems? Even if the
      assumptions used to model a social system are simple, the
      consequences can be far from obvious if the system is composed
      of many interacting agents. The large-scale effects of
      interacting agents are often surprising because it can be hard
      to anticipate the full consequences of even simple forms of
      interaction. For example, one of the earliest and most elegant
      agent-based models — the
      <a href="http://nifty.stanford.edu/2014/mccown-schelling-model-segregation/"
      target=new>city segregation (or “tipping”) model</a> developed
      by
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Schelling"
      target=new>Thomas Schelling</a> — demonstrates how residential
      segregation can emerge from individual choices even when
      everyone is fairly tolerant.
    </li>
    <li>
      <I>Methodological advancement.</I> How best to provide ABM
      researchers with the methods and tools they need to undertake
      the rigorous study of social systems through controlled
      computational experiments? ABM researchers are exploring a
      variety of ways to address this objective ranging from careful
      consideration of methodological principles to the practical
      development of programming and visualization tools.
      <BR>
	ABMs make possible:
      <ol>
	<li>
	  the rigorous testing, refinement, and extension of existing
	  theories that have proved to be difficult to formulate and
	  evaluate using standard statistical and mathematical tools;
	  and
	</li>
	<li>
	  a deeper understanding of fundamental causal mechanisms in
	  multi-agent systems whose study is currently separated by
	  artificial disciplinary boundaries.
	</li>

	Computational Approach</I></a>, Proceedings of the National
	Academy of Sciences, USA, Vol. 99, pp. 7243–7250.  Epstein
	uses a spatial agent-based model to explore civil violence. A
	central authority uses “cops” to arrest (remove) actively
	rebelling citizens from the society for a specified jail
	term. In each time step, each agent (cop or citizen) randomly
	moves to a new unoccupied site within its limited vision. A
	rebelling citizen’s estimated arrest probability is assumed to
	fall as the ratio of actively rebelling citizens to cops that
	the citizen perceives in its vicinity increases.  Each citizen
	in each time step decides whether to actively rebel or not
	depending on this perceived ratio. Epstein shows how the
	complex dynamics resulting from these simple assumptions can
	generate empirically interesting macroscopic regularities that
	are difficult to analyze using more standard modeling
	approaches.

      Individual Competition</I></a>, Computational Economics,
      Vol. 18, pp. 9–24.  An ABM to study an important observed aspect
      of social norm evolution: namely, that the amount of time an
      individual devotes to thinking about a behavior tends to be
      inversely related to the strength of the social norms that
      relate to this behavior. In the limit, once a behavioral norm is
      firmly entrenched in a society, individuals tend to conform to
      the norm without explicit thought. Epstein’s model permits
      agents to learn how to behave (what behavioral norm to adopt),
      but it also permits agents to learn how much to think about how
      to behave.

      <I>Political Institutions and Sorting in a Tiebout Model</I>,
      American Economic Review, Vol. 87, pp. 977–992. An ABM that
      explores how social outcomes are affected by the political
      institutions used to aggregate individual choices on local
      public goods issues, such as whether or not to finance a
      community swimming pool. (Examples of institutions: referenda,
      two-party competition, and proportional representation.)  For
      each tested political institution, citizens “vote with their
      feet” in each time period regarding which jurisdiction they wish
      to inhabit. The policy positions resulting in any given
      jurisdiction depend on the preferences of the citizens located
      within it, as determined by the political institution in
      force. Citizens can continue to relocate in response to changing
      local policy positions, and local policy positions can continue
      to change in response to citizen relocations. The authors find
      that social efficiency is highest under political institutions
      such as two-party competition or proportional representation
      that initially induce citizens to undertake a suitable degree of
      experimentation among alternative jurisdictions.
