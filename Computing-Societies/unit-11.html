  <P>
    <ul>
      <li>
	<I>Inequality in nature and society</I> [Scheffer, van
	Bavel, van de Leemput, and van Nes, 2017].

  </P>
  <P>
    Inequality is one of the main drivers of social tension. We show
    striking similarities between patterns of inequality between
    species abundances in nature and
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth"
    target=new>wealth</a> in society. We demonstrate that in the
    absence of equalizing forces, such large inequality will arise
    from chance alone. While natural enemies have an equalizing effect
    in nature, inequality in societies can be suppressed by
    wealth-equalizing institutions. However, over the past millennium,
    such institutions have been weakened during periods of societal
    upscaling. Our analysis suggests that due to the very same
    mathematical principle that rules natural communities (indeed, a
    “law of nature”) extreme wealth inequality is inevitable in a
    globalizing world unless effective wealth-equalizing institutions
    are installed on a global scale.
  </P>
  
</DIV>



<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>the findings in brief</h1>

  <P>
    Most societies are economically dominated by a small elite, and
    similarly, natural communities are typically dominated by a small
    fraction of the species. Here we reveal a strong similarity
    between patterns of inequality in nature and society, hinting at
    fundamental unifying mechanisms.
  </P>
  <P>
    We show that <I>chance alone</I> will drive 1% or less of the
    community to dominate 50% of all resources in situations where
    gains and losses are multiplicative, as in
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_interest"
    target=new>returns on assets</a> or growth rates of populations
    [see
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_growth"
    target=new>exponential growth</a>].
  </P>
  <P>
    Key mechanisms that counteract such
    hyper<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(ecology)"
    target=new>dominance</a> include natural enemies in nature and
    wealth-equalizing institutions in society. However, historical
    research of European developments over the past millennium
    suggests that such institutions become ineffective in times of
    societal upscaling. A corollary is that in a globalizing world,
    wealth will inevitably be appropriated by a very small fraction of
    the population unless effective wealth-equalizing institutions
    emerge at the global level.
  </P>

<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>examples of patterns of inequality in nature and in society</h1>

  <img src="Scheffer17-fig1.png" class="figure-right" height=500>
    <P>
      Inequality in society (<I>left</I> column) and nature
      (<I>right</I> column). 
      <ol type=A>
	<li>
	  The wealth distribution of the world’s 1,800 billionaires.
	</li>
	<li>
	  The abundance distribution among the most common trees in
	  the Amazon forest.
	</li>
	<li>
	  The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient"
		 target=new>Gini index</a> of wealth in countries.
	</li>
	<li>
	  The Gini index of abundance in a large set of natural
	  communities.
	</li>
      </ol>
    </P>
    <P>
      These patterns raise the question of whether the similarities
      between nature and society are a coincidence or might hint at
      universal underlying processes.  Viewed in detail, the complex
      interplay of mechanisms that govern wealth distribution in
      society is obviously very different from the processes
      regulating the abundance of species in nature.  However, on an
      abstract level, there are in fact comparable generic processes
      at play (as shown next).

  <h1>mechanisms that drive inequality</h1>

  <img src="Scheffer17-fig2.png" class="figure-right" height=300>
    <P>
      Four unifying mechanisms that shape inequality and their
      specific drivers in nature (solid lines) and society (text boxes
      with dashed borders).
    </P>    
    <P>
      Increasing inequality:
      <ol type=I>
	<li>
	  An inherent difference in competitive power of the
	  actors. Particular sets of traits give some species a
	  competitive edge, just as in society some individuals have
	  traits that set them up for entrepreneurial success.
	  Furthermore, dominance can be self-reinforcing. In most
	  societies,
	  <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.strueco.2019.09.005"
	  target=new>wealth can come with power to set the rules</a>
	  in ways that favor further wealth concentration.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Surprisingly, <B>chance</B> may be another particularly
	  powerful driver of inequality. Even if no actor is
	  intrinsically superior to others, inequality can emerge
	  naturally if wealth (or abundance) is subject to random
	  multiplicative losses or gains. In a finite,
	  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum_game"
	  target=new>zero-sum</a> world, the effect of multiplicative
	  random processes blows up to create extreme inequality.
	</li>
      </ol>
      Decreasing inequality:
      <ol type=I start=3>
	<li>
	  Suppressing dominance.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Lifting up from zero.

      </ol>

  <h1>multiplicative random losses/gains lead to inequality</h1>

  <img src="Scheffer17-fig3.png" class="figure-right" height=400>
    <P>
      Examples showing how simulations of wealth of actors
      (<I>left</I>) starting from an entirely equal situation quickly
      lead to inequality (<I>right</I>) emerging solely from
      multiplicative gains and losses of otherwise equivalent
      competitors.
    </P>
    <P>
      The simulations shown in A and B are without savings, while
      those in C and D represent simulations with savings. The
      difference illustrates that such an additive process reduces the
      tendency for hyperdominance generated by the multiplicative
      gains and losses.
    </P>
    <P>
      The results are generated by a minimal model of wealth. Similar
      results can be obtained from a model of neutrally competing
      species in a natural community.

<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>equalizing mechanisms: suppression of dominance</h1>

  <P>
    In nature, this is an omnipresent phenomenon.
    <ul>
      <li>
	In nature, the most abundant species tend to suffer
	proportionally more from natural enemies, including diseases,
	a mechanism that reduces dominance and allows a larger number
	of species to share resources. In the literature on microbial
	systems, this is known as the
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kill_the_Winner_hypothesis"
	target=new>“kill the winner” principle</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
	In societies, there is no comparable natural mechanism to
	constrain dominance. Occasional disasters, such as major wars,
	may have an equalizing effect by destroying capital or
	inducing redistribution, but in the long run inequality
	generally returns to the previous level.
      </li>
      <li>
	Economic growth also has been suggested to dampen
	inequality. However, analysis of our minimal model suggests
	that neither the occasional destruction of capital nor
	economic growth should be expected to markedly reduce
	inequality in the theoretical context of chance-driven
	dynamics.
      </li>
      <li>
	On the other hand, societies do install institutions that may
	either sustain wealth inequality or reduce it and that have
	long-lasting (or quasi-permanent) effects on levels of wealth
	inequality. Power associated with wealth tends to facilitate
	further enrichment through the installation of
	wealth-protecting institutions, such as absolute property
	rights and the right to inherit. In contrast, societies may
	also install institutions that dampen inequality, such as
	taxation schemes.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </P>

<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>equalizing mechanisms: lifting out of the zero state</h1>
  
  <P>
    A small additive influx is a powerful antidote to the stickiness
    of the zero state.
    <ul>
      <li>
	In nature, local populations typically receive a trickle of
	immigration that contributes to population size in such an
	additive way.
      </li>
      <li>
	In society, savings from income represent an additive
	contribution to wealth. Adding such a flux to our minimal
	model of wealth allows more households to gain wealth, thus
	populating the middle class and regularly breaking episodes of
	dominance by the previously dominant households.
      </li>
      <li>
	Altough saving is plausibly a way out of poverty, both
	historical and contemporary rates of savings are often close
	to zero for most households.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </P>
   
</DIV>    
    


<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>the instability of the equalizing mechanisms</h1>

  <P>
    <ul>
      <li>
	In nature, the importance of suppression of dominance is
	vividly illustrated by the occasional spectacular population
	explosion of newly invading species, explained by the release
	from the natural enemies they left behind: the so-called
	<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/421585a?draft=collection&proof=true"
	target=new>“parasites lost”</a> phenomenon. The balance is
	typically restored over the subsequent decades as natural
	enemies catch up with the newcomers.
      </li>
      <li>
	In societies, control of wealth inequality is also notoriously
	unstable over time. The drop and rebound in inequality over
	the last century has received much attention, but a careful
	analysis of historical sources reveals several waves of rising
	and falling inequality in history. Some of those cycles look
	surprisingly regular, suggesting that they might be governed
	by universal basic forces. Indeed, inequality and conflict are
	common elements across historical analyses, even though
	precise mechanisms of their interaction differ among cases.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </P>
  <P>
    Institutions can play a dominant and long-lasting role in shaping
    societal prosperity and inequality.  For example,
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance_tax"
    target=new>inheritance tax</a> limits wealth transfer to the next
    generation. However,
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globalization"
    target=new>globalization</a> has given way to a more unconstrained
    use and accumulation of wealth.  Mobility of wealth has greatly
    increased, providing immunity to national taxation and other
    institutional obstacles to wealth accumulation.
  </P>
  <P>
    Several historical cycles of inequality may be explained, at least
    in part, by the emergence of equalizing institutions followed by
    periods during which various mechanisms undermined the
    effectiveness of these institutions.
  </P>
   
</DIV>    
    


<div  CLASS="slide">
  <h1>conclusions</h1>

  <BR>
  <P>
    Although the surprising similarity between inequality of species
    abundances and wealth may have the same roots on an abstract
    level, this does not imply that wealth inequality is “natural.”
    Wealth inequality may have emerged as far back as the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolithic"
    target=new>Neolithic era</a>, the relative amount of wealth
    appropriated by the richest has increased as societies have scaled
    up.
  </P>
  <P>
    One explanation for this effect is scale itself. Put simply, one
    can accumulate less wealth in a village than across the
    globe.
  </P>
  <P>
    However, another explanation is that installing effective
    institutions to dampen inequality becomes more challenging as
    scale increases.
  </P>
  <P class="incremental">
    [See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostracism" target=new>ostracism</a>]
  </P>
  <P>
    Excessive concentration of wealth is widely thought to hamper
    economic growth, concentrate power in the hands of a small elite,
    and increase the chance of social unrest and political
    instability. This raises questions about the prospects for current
    societies.  Phases of upscaling of governance successfully curbed
    unconstrained growth of inequality first in the communities of
    late medieval Europe and later in the nation states of the 20th
    century, but in both cases, this was a lengthy and painful
    process. Whether scaling up of effective governance can now be
    done at the global level and, if so, what this new form of
    governance might look like, remains unclear.
  </P>
