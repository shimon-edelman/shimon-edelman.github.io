Hummel's reference to ``countless other ways'' in which our model of
structure processing is deficient, along with the claim that it cannot
account for ``any of the hallmarks of the human ability to perceive
spatial relations,'' exemplifies the tactic favored by the defenders
of the structural description (SD) approach across cognition: broaden
the scope of the discussion to reduce the impact of a refutation of a
particular instance of the theory. A similar situation prevails in
linguistics, where no amount of evidence seems to suffice to send
transformational generative grammar to the dumpster: the theory of
grammar keeps mutating over the decades [<A
 HREF="http://kybele.psych.cornell.edu/~edelman/response-to-Hummel/node1.html#EdelmanChristiansen03">Edelman and Christiansen, 2003</A>],
and there is always some ``performance-related'' excuse for sticking
to rule-based explanations. This will not do: the proponents of SD
should decide whether or not their theory is refutable in principle in
the context of a well-defined set of observations, such as those
offered in [<A
 HREF="http://kybele.psych.cornell.edu/~edelman/response-to-Hummel/node1.html#Hummel00">Hummel, 2000</A>] and a well-defined model, such as that of
[<A
 HREF="http://kybele.psych.cornell.edu/~edelman/response-to-Hummel/node1.html#HummelBiederman92">Hummel and Biederman, 1992</A>] or [<A
 HREF="http://kybele.psych.cornell.edu/~edelman/response-to-Hummel/node1.html#Hummel01">Hummel, 2001</A>].

<P>
Refuting the SD approach was not, however, our goal in the article
commented upon by Hummel.  Likewise, the ability of SD models to deal
with any entities standing in any relation to each other is not
ignored by us (as Hummel claims in the penultimate paragraph). On the
contrary, it is precisely this property of SD that makes them too
powerful (hence biologically irrelevant, unless properly constrained),
as we discuss at length in section 1.2. Consequently, we set out to
develop a limited, yet conceptually and computationally plausible
alternative to SD, to implement it using biologically uncontroversial
mechanisms -- a category that includes <I>what+where</I> neurons, but
excludes dynamic binding [<A
 HREF="http://kybele.psych.cornell.edu/~edelman/response-to-Hummel/node1.html#Kirschfeld95">Kirschfeld, 1995</A>,<A
 HREF="http://kybele.psych.cornell.edu/~edelman/response-to-Hummel/node1.html#Lennie98">Lennie, 1998</A>] -- and to test
the implementation on real, manually unpreprocessed images (something
that no SD model is capable of at present). In this admittedly
circumscribed project we have succeeded.

<P>
We note that Hummel's equation of <I>what+where</I> with conjunctive
coding betrays a basic misunderstanding of our approach. It is the
combination of <I>what+where</I> code at one level with a
bottom-up/top-down ``computation cube'' scheme that enables our model
to exhibit (limited) systematicity. This computational stance leads to
predictions of analogous limitations in human performance, which we
state in section 5.4. We also note that the crucial psychophysical
experiments have yet to be performed; we are aware of no published
studies of the representation of structure that use unfamiliar-looking
or even just complex shapes and configurations while discouraging
scrutiny and abstract, extra-visual reasoning on the part of the
subject.

<P>
In summary, we believe (appropriating Mahatma Gandhi's quip concerning
the Western civilization) that SD would be a good idea -- (1) if the
visual world were uniquely describable in terms of compositions of
parts, (2) if human observers were systematic in their processing of
novel arrangements of unfamiliar visual stimuli, and (3) if the
detection of the parts and relations were computationally feasible.
Unfortunately, the stance expressed by the first condition is
philosophically naive [<A
 HREF="http://kybele.psych.cornell.edu/~edelman/response-to-Hummel/node1.html#Akins96">Akins, 1996</A>,<A
 HREF="http://kybele.psych.cornell.edu/~edelman/response-to-Hummel/node1.html#Smith01">Smith, 2001</A>], the second is
empirically unfounded, and the third is increasingly perceived by the
computer vision community as unrealistic
[<A
 HREF="http://kybele.psych.cornell.edu/~edelman/response-to-Hummel/node1.html#BarrowTenenbaum93">Barrow and Tenenbaum, 1993</A>,<A
 HREF="http://kybele.psych.cornell.edu/~edelman/response-to-Hummel/node1.html#Dickinson97panel">Dickinson et&nbsp;al., 1997</A>]. It looks like limited
systematicity may prove to be the only game in town.
