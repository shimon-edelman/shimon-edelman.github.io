<H3>Abstract:</H3>
<DIV>Two of the premises of the target paper -- surface reconstruction
  as the goal of early vision, and inaccessibility of intermediate
  stages in the process presumably leading to such reconstruction --
  are questioned and found wanting.

<P>
</DIV>
<P>
<P>
According to Pylyshyn, a certain chunk of vision machinery, which he
calls the early vision module, is not accessible to ``cognitive''
intervention; at most, attentional control over the locus of
application of that module can be exercised. This approach is part of
a general strategy that treats the mind as modular [<A
 HREF="pylyshyn-commentary.html#Fodor83">Fodor, 1983</A>],
seeking to divide it into various cognitive faculties (presumably,
each of these is to be conquered by theorists later, when the genies
are securely confined to their bottles).  In vision research, this
amounts to postulating that all the visual processing between the
retinal image and the mythical 2.5-D Sketch [<A
 HREF="pylyshyn-commentary.html#Marr82">Marr, 1982</A>] is
inaccessible to the rest of cognition.

<P>
For this claim to be of interest, the cognitively impenetrable early
vision module must be charged with a substantial portion of the visual
processing burden. If all the vision module was doing were to make a
few small steps away from the raw image (say, detecting abrupt
intensity transitions or ``edges'' in the stimulus image), the vision
genie would be too puny to justify imprisonment.

<P>
The crucial issue, which the target article commendably puts squarely
on the table in section&nbsp;7, is, then, this: what is the output of the
visual system? If there was ever a $64K question in vision research,
this is surely it: if you know the answer, you know the nature of the
internal representation of the visual world. Pylyshyn offers one
possible answer: in section&nbsp;7, he claims that ``...evidence favors
the view that some depth-encoded surface representation of the layout
[of the scene] is present in the output of the early-vision system.''

<P>
Such surface representation must be both explicit and obligatory
(``automatic''), as per the 2.5-D Sketch doctrine [<A
 HREF="pylyshyn-commentary.html#Marr82">Marr, 1982</A>], if
the modularity thesis is to be worth defending in the context of
vision. In other words, the system must maintain depth representation
of all the visible surfaces at all times -- or else suffer the
consequences of its inability to salvage the intermediate
representations, to which, alas, the mind has no access (according to
Pylyshyn).

<P>
In fact, none of these two alternatives fully corresponds to the
psychophysical reality. On the one hand, the postulate of obligatory
surface reconstruction is undermined (i) by the scarcity of empirical
support, (ii) by the ability of current models of recognition and
categorization to do without surface representation as such, and (iii)
by the indications that arbitrarily sketchy representations are passed
off routinely as the real thing by the visual system.  On the other
hand, cognitive control can be easily exerted over the system's
response to seemingly arbitrary combinations of very low-level
features such as individual dots and lines. Let us consider each of
these issues in turn.

<P>
Although some experiments testing the idea of explicit surface
reconstruction have been carried out, the interpretation of their
results is debatable.  Studies that actually claim to have
demonstrated that under certain circumstances surfaces are represented
explicitly tend to rely on the subject's report of the perceived
surface [<A
 HREF="pylyshyn-commentary.html#TreueAndersenAndoHildreth95">Treue et al., 1995</A>], a technique prone to what
Dennett (1991) terms an internal revision. For example, it is
conceivable that the system labels a portion of the visual field as
``that surface'' while actually marking only a tiny minority of the
relevant pixels -- perhaps those near the experimenter's probe -- as
belonging to it (see [<A
 HREF="pylyshyn-commentary.html#Dennett91">Dennett, 1991</A>], p.344).<A NAME="tex2html1"
 HREF="pylyshyn-commentary.html#foot29"><SUP>1</SUP></A> In 1992, Nakayama and Shimojo
 summarized their psychophysical study of
surface interpolation as follows: ``We have suggested that sampled
images can be associated with surfaces, not mentioning the
representation of surfaces themselves. [...] Because we have no
specific data to address this issue directly, we can only speculate.''
(pp.1362-3). At present, the issue of explicit representation of
surfaces is still undecided: the survey of [<A
 HREF="pylyshyn-commentary.html#PessoaThompsonNoe98">Pessoa et al., 1998</A>]
ends with a series of six conclusions, which by no means settle the
debate one way or the other.<A NAME="tex2html2"
 HREF="pylyshyn-commentary.html#foot21"><SUP>2</SUP></A>

<P>
A serious problem facing the hypothesis of surface reconstruction
stems from the indications that the perceptual functions thought by
Marr to be the culmination and the very purpose of reconstruction --
object recognition and categorization -- need not actually involve
anything like the 2.5-D Sketch
[<A
 HREF="pylyshyn-commentary.html#BulthoffEdelmanTarr95">B&#252;lthoff et al., 1995</A>,<A
 HREF="pylyshyn-commentary.html#EdelmanDuvdevani97rsoc">Edelman and Duvdevani-Bar, 1997</A>,<A
 HREF="pylyshyn-commentary.html#Mel97">Mel, 1997</A>].  This begs
the question why, in perceptual scenarios that do not call for an
interaction with object surfaces, should the visual system bother with
the computationally intensive and error-prone reconstruction in the
first place. Indeed, mounting evidence (some of it cited in the target
article) suggests that little of the scene structure beyond its
general layout (described in terms of object categories, not raw
surfaces) may be retained even in short-term memory
[<A
 HREF="pylyshyn-commentary.html#ORegan92">O'Regan, 1992</A>,<A
 HREF="pylyshyn-commentary.html#BlackmoreEtAl95">Blackmore et al., 1995</A>,<A
 HREF="pylyshyn-commentary.html#Simons96">Simons, 1996</A>].

<P>
When the uncertainty of actual surface reconstruction is combined with
Pylyshyn's belief that anything less than a reconstructed surface is
not accessible to cognition,<A NAME="tex2html3"
 HREF="pylyshyn-commentary.html#foot24"><SUP>3</SUP></A> common perceptual phenomena
that are the mainstay of classical visual psychophysics become great
puzzles. For instance, one wonders why it is so easy to have subjects
respond to simple stimuli consisting of dots or lines -- entities
that, according to Pylyshyn's claim, are locked inside the early
vision module (in Marr's terminology, these would be part of the
Primal Sketch, a hypothetical stage preceding the surface
reconstruction in the 2.5-D sketch; an example of a task involving
such stimuli is vernier discrimination, mentioned in section&nbsp;6.3 of
the target article).  Unless the ``cognitively impenetrable'' early
vision module is assigned a more substantial role than chasing around
a few points in the visual field, Pylyshyn's thesis loses much of its
poignancy.
