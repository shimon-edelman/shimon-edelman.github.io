<h3>The motivation: determinants and dynamics of (un)happiness</h3>
<a name="intro">

<P width=300>
Our present understanding of how the mind works and how minds evolve
 suggests that the pursuit of happiness is a basic human right in a deeper
 sense than warranted by the Declaration of Independence: our capacity for
 moment-to-moment emotional well-being and our ability to appreciate life as
 a whole are both rooted deep in the human nature.  The  human potential for
 happiness cannot, however, be realized if circumstances  oppose it. Indeed,
 contrary to the popular myth of the happy pauper, studies show that
 widespread chronic financial hardship and insecurity and the inequality in
 power and wealth distribution — two chronic aspects of American
 socioeconomic malaise that the Great Recession has greatly exacerbated —
 are both detrimental to happiness.
</P>

<P width=300>
A reflection on the dynamics of this predicament indicates that it may
be self-reinforcing. A panoply of factors act not just to preserve the
status quo, but to deepen the existing divides. Some of these factors
are psychological. For instance, research findings show that
inequality is associated both with increased illusory self-enhancement
and with increased system justification, which in turn help perpetuate
inequality. Moreover, both attention to in-group/out-group
distinctions and the possession of personal power over others
strengthen the perception of "the other" as less human, which may
reduce the motivation of those in power to share it more equitably.
</P>

<P width=300>
Other factors acting to preserve or exacerbate a skewed distribution
of power are political. Corporate control of the media, the unbridled
influence of private money on the machinery of democracy, and the
continued attacks on science and erosion of public education all
ensure that the society's attention is diverted away from the root
causes of its ills.  Instead of being encouraged to think, the average
consumer of the news, increasingly deprived through the lack of
education of cognitive tools for critical analysis, is lured into
acquiescence with the status quo by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspeak"
 target=new>Newspeak</a>-like memes, which pretend 
that freedom to die from lack of health insurance is the epitome of
freedom, or that everyone in this country can "make it" if only they
work hard enough.
