<B>Abstract</B>. This book should be a required reading for any serious student of the
brain. The scope and the accessibility of its presentation of the
neurobiological data (especially the functional anatomy of select
parts of the central nervous system) more than make up for the
peculiarities of the theoretical stance it adopts.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00010000000000000000">
A scrambled mosaic</A>
</H1>

<P>
One bright June day in graduate school, I asked my advisor to
recommend some reading material for the approaching summer. One of the
articles thus recommended left me with an impression sufficiently
vivid to prompt total recall on the slightest provocation (such as the
groping for an opening line for the present review). The article in
question (Gilbert, 1983), albeit informative and well-written, evoked
a lingering feeling of disappointment, no doubt because its title --
<EM>Microcircuitry of the visual cortex</EM> -- had initially sounded
misleadingly suggestive to a literally-minded ex-electrical engineer
such as myself. That article listed all manner of neurons and their
distribution throughout the visual cortex, but, alas, did not quite
specify wiring diagrams.

<P>
Satisfyingly, <EM>Neural Organization</EM> (henceforth <EM>NeO</EM>) does provide
some actual wiring diagrams, and not just for the visual cortex. The
anatomy of other neocortical, archicortical, thalamic and cerebellar
structures is discussed, as well as their development, and models of
their function. All this adds up to a grand tableau resembling nothing
as much as a Joycean procession of saints ``bearing symbols of their
efficacies,'' complete with buckshot, beards, bellows and beehives
(not to mention eyes on a dish).<A NAME="tex2html1"
 HREF="ArbibEtAl-BBS.html#foot26"><SUP>1</SUP></A>

<P>
The attempt undertaken by the authors of <EM>NeO</EM> introduce some order
into the masses of currently available findings on brain function is
highly commendable. That the result appears less orderly than hoped
for can be attributed in part to the sheer scale of the enterprise. It
is tempting to compare the present state of knowledge in neurobiology
(and, on a different level, in cognitive psychology) to that of
pre-Ptolemean astronomy: there are observations to be explained, but
theories (even wrong ones) are hard to come by. This analogy, however,
is strained: the amount of neurobiological data to be explained is
vaster than anything that Ptolemy (or even Kepler) had to confront,
and the explanation is highly unlikely to consist of a few equations
accompanied by a simple diagram.  The problem of commenting on books
such as <EM>NeO</EM>, therefore, this: how to evaluate an attempt to
reconstruct a huge scrambled mosaic, without having a clear idea of
what the big picture is supposed to show, or, for that matter, whether
or not there <EM>is</EM> a single big picture at all.<A NAME="tex2html2"
 HREF="ArbibEtAl-BBS.html#foot56"><SUP>2</SUP></A>

<P>
In lieu of speculations concerning the existence and the possible
nature of the big picture, <EM>NeO</EM> offers three threads common to all the
chapters: structure, function, and dynamics (as reflected in the
book's subtitle). I shall comment on these in the reverse order,
starting with dynamics.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00020000000000000000">
Dynamics</A>
</H1>

<P>
The argument underlying <EM>NeO</EM>'s construal of dynamics as an
all-encompassing explanatory paradigm is that of unity of approach
across time scales. The basic premise -- that phenomena involving
change over time are properly described by differential equations --
is unimpeachable. I wonder, however, whether it is productive to lump
together, say, compartmental models of membrane potential in single
neurons on the one hand and models of development of neural wiring on
the other hand. Differential equations are ubiquitous in the sciences;
most scientists, however, do not take this to mean that all natural
phenomena, even in their own field, are merely different aspects of a
single whole.<A NAME="tex2html3"
 HREF="ArbibEtAl-BBS.html#foot30"><SUP>3</SUP></A>

<P>
Fortunately (I think), <EM>NeO</EM> does not actually adhere to this extreme
approach: apart from chapter&nbsp;4 (which offers a very good survey of
``dynamical system theory'') and a few paragraphs in the last chapter,
``dynamics'' does not play too prominent a role in the
book. Typically, dynamics and differential equations tend to crop up
where explanatory (rather than descriptive) approaches are as yet
unavailable. For example, towards the end of chapter&nbsp;4, ``invariant''
pattern recognition is finessed into the ``binding problem'' and is
offered a solution in the form of von der Malsburg's Dynamic Link
Architecture (p.102) -- a model which only becomes relevant if one
accepts the prior assumption that binding is indeed a
problem.<A NAME="tex2html4"
 HREF="ArbibEtAl-BBS.html#foot57"><SUP>4</SUP></A> Likewise, in chapter&nbsp;8 (which is devoted
to the cerebral cortex), one finds dynamical models of ocular
dominance formation (nothing is said about <EM>why</EM> there are ocular
dominance columns in the first place), and of thalamo-cortical
oscillations (another phenomenon whose function remains obscure).

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00030000000000000000">
Function and schemata</A>
</H1>

<P>
If we relegate dynamics to the status of a mathematical means rather
than an explanatory end, the issue of function is brought to the
fore. Regrettably, <EM>NeO</EM> takes ``function'' consistently to mean ``how
does this bit of the brain function?''  rather than ``what does this
bit of the brain do for living?'' In other words, no clear distinction
is made between explanation of operation and explanation of goals and
means.

<P>
The dearth of this latter kind of explanation is apparent throughout
the book.  For example, the most succinct and explicit description of
the function of the visual cortex in all of chapter&nbsp;8 is found in a
quote from J.&nbsp;Maunsell, suggesting that ``while the early stages of
processing in the visual pathway provide a faithful representation of
the retinal image, later stages of processing in the visual cortex
hold representations that emphasize the viewer's current interest''
(p.223). To be sure; but what are these representations, and why do
they have the properties they do, and how do they support visual
behavior?

<P>
The preference for operational rather than functional explanation that
one finds in <EM>NeO</EM> is explicitly justified in section&nbsp;11.2.2 (<EM>
Brain Theory</EM>): ``The issue for the brain theorist, then, is to map
complex functions, behaviors, and patterns of thought either on the
interactions of these rather large entities (anatomically defined
brain regions) or on these very small and numerous components (the
neurons)'' (p.338). It seems to me that such a mapping would
constitute an incomplete theory of the brain, unless it includes an
explanation of its function (over and above its operation). The
theoretical concepts which <EM>NeO</EM> brings to bear on this issue --
dynamics, self-organization, and schemata -- are inherently incapable
of filling this lacuna. The reason for this is simple: dynamics,
self-organization and schemata all belong to a level of explanation
that deals with the operation of a system, rather than its function.
In particular, attempting to explain the function of a system by
saying that it employs schemata is like explaining how a computer
program fulfills its function by saying that it employs subroutines
(to make this analogy work better imagine applying it to some really
complicated piece of software, such as  SABRE, the flight
reservation system).

<P>
<EM>NeO</EM> devotes the entire chapter&nbsp;3 to an explanation of the concept of
schema. The overview is excellent and wide-ranging, but it does not
convince me that recruiting schemata as an explanatory aid (let alone
making the concept of schemata an explanation <EM>an sich</EM>) can
advance a theory that does not otherwise address itself to the
functional level. Intuitively, the idea of multiple schemata, agents,
subroutines, etc. operating in parallel seems to be a very plausible
framework for trying to understand brain and behavior. In itself,
however, it is not an explanation, and attempts to present it as such
tend to give rise to oxymoronic titles such as ``A Robot that Walks:
<EM>Emergent</EM> Behaviors from a <EM>Carefully Evolved</EM> Network''
(Brooks, 1989); the italics are mine. In other words, if you want
your flock of schemata to cooperate and do something useful, these
days you still have to carefully engineer your system, and that takes
understanding. Moreover, if you ever succeed to have the schemata
evolve without supervision, you'd still want to analyze the emergent
behavior to gain understanding of what is going on -- just the
problem we have with explaining brain function.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00040000000000000000">
Anatomy</A>
</H1>

<P>
The discussion of structure (that is, anatomy) is truly excellent
throughout the book (which is only expected, given
J.&nbsp;Szent&#225;gothai's contributions to this field over the past
half-century). The anatomical data are presented in a lucid form, and
are accompanied by outstanding illustrations and a good discussion.  I
found the chapter on the hippocampus, with its ``systems view''
(p.170), especially illuminating. The problem of integrating current
ideas about the function (not merely the operation) of hippocampus in
animals and in humans is well-presented.  The prospects of linking the
idea of cognitive maps with more general notions of memory and other
cognitive processes are very intriguing. The possibility of the
involvement of the hippocampus in the representation of relational
information (discussed on pp.182-4)<A NAME="tex2html5"
 HREF="ArbibEtAl-BBS.html#foot58"><SUP>5</SUP></A> is fascinating, in view of the present
attempts of brain theorists to address the so-called problem of
compositionality (Bienenstock and Geman, 1995). I hope this section will
prompt further studies and will generate more discussion in the
future.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00050000000000000000">
Summary</A>
</H1>

<P>
The last chapter of <EM>NeO</EM> presents some wonderful opportunities for a
lively debate. To quote just one example, the reader is told that
``Digital computers ...have low adaptability'' (p.340); this <EM>
must</EM> mean that a compartmental simulation of a neural circuit running
on a digital computer is equally handicapped.  For the sake of
brevity, I shall forego all these opportunities,<A NAME="tex2html6"
 HREF="ArbibEtAl-BBS.html#foot59"><SUP>6</SUP></A> and proceed to summarize my impression of the book. 

<P>
I believe that this book is a required reading for any serious student
of the brain. Even if one disagrees with the theories <EM>NeO</EM> propounds,
the scope and the accessibility of its presentation of the
neurobiological data make it more useful than most textbooks and many
reviews.<A NAME="tex2html7"
 HREF="ArbibEtAl-BBS.html#foot48"><SUP>7</SUP></A> My guess is that <EM>NeO</EM> will stimulate many
readers to try their own hand at the big mosaic, perhaps playing Theon
and Hipparchus to a future <A HREF="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Ptolemy.html">Ptolemy</A> -- or maybe even <A HREF="http://www.phys.virginia.edu/classes/109N/1995/lectures/tychob.html">Brahe</A> to
someone's Kepler.
