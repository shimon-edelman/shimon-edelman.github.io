<h3>Seminar description</h3>

<P width=300>
Creativity is commonly perceived by the public as the "last bastion" that
 still stands in the face of the explanatory onslaught of psychology and
 neuroscience — a human capacity that is yet to be given a satisfactory
 mechanistic account, or, according to the more extreme stance, a capacity
 that cannot in principle be explained in mechanistic terms (one other
 faculty of the mind that stands out in the same manner is <a
 href="../Psych-4320/index.html"
 target=new>consciousness</a>). In this seminar, we shall discuss
 imagination and creativity, drawing on classical and recent thinking in
 psychological and literary theory, drawing on results from computational
 cognitive science and neuroscience, and from theory of evolution and
 emergence.
