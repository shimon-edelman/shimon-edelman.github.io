David Courtnay Marr was born on January 19, 1945 in Essex, England.
He attended Rugby, the English public school, on a scholarship, and
went on to Trinity College, Cambridge. By 1966, he obtained his B.S. and M.S. in mathematics, and proceeded to work on his doctorate in
theoretical neuroscience, under the supervision of Giles
Brindley. Having studied the literature for a year, Marr commenced
writing his dissertation. The results, published in the form of three
journal papers between 1969 and 1971, amounted to a theory of
mammalian brain function, parts of which remain relevant to the
present day, despite vast advances in neurobiology in the past three
decades. Marr's theory was formulated in rigorous terms, yet was
sufficiently concrete to be examined in view of the then available
anatomical and physiological data.  Between 1971 and 1972, Marr's
attention shifted from general theory of the brain to the study of
vision. In 1973, he joined the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology as a visiting scientist,
taking on a faculty appointment in the Department of Psychology in
1977, where he was made a tenured full professor in 1980.  In the
winter of 1978 he was diagnosed with acute leukemia. David Marr died
on November 17, 1980, in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  His highly
influential book, <EM>Vision: A Computational Investigation into the
Human Representation and Processing of Visual Information</EM>, which has
redefined and revitalized the study of human and machine vision, has
been published posthumously, in 1982.

<P>
Marr's initial work in neuroscience combined high-level theoretical
speculation with meticulous synthesis of the anatomical data available
at the time. The question he chose to address is the <I>nec plus
ultra</I> of neuroscience: what is it that the brain does?  Marr proposed
a definite answer to this question for each of three major brain
structures: archicortex (the phylogenetically older part of the
cerebral cortex), cerebellum, and neocortex. The three answers
complement each other, rallying around the idea that the brain's
central function is statistical pattern recognition and association,
carried out in a very high-dimensional space of ``elemental''
features. The basic building block of all three theories is a <EM>codon</EM>, or a subset of features, with which there may be associated a
cell, wired so as to fire in the presence of that particular codon.

<P>
In the first paper, Marr proposed that the cerebellum's task is to
learn the motor skills involved in performing actions and maintaining
posture [<A
 HREF="node1.html#Marr69">Marr, 1969</A>]. The Purkinje cells in the cerebellar cortex,
presumably implementing the codon representation, associate (through
synaptic modification) a particular action with the context in which
it is performed. Subsequently, the context alone causes the Purkinje
cell to fire, which in turn precipitates the next elemental
movement. Thirty years later, a significant proportion of researchers
working on the cerebellum seem to consider this model as ``generally
correct'' -- a striking exception in a field where the <I>nihil
nisi bene</I> maxim is not known to be observed.

<P>
The next paper [<A
 HREF="node1.html#Marr70">Marr, 1970</A>] extended the codon theory to encompass a
more general kind of statistical concept learning, which he assessed
as ``capable of serving many of the aspects of the brain's function''
(the vagueness of this aspect of the theory would lead him soon to
abandon this approach, which, as he realized all along, was ``once
removed from the description of any task the cerebrum might
perform'').  How can a mere handful of techniques for organizing
information (such as the codon representation) support a general
theory of the brain function? Marr's views in this matter are
profoundly Realist, and are based on a postulate of ``the prevalence
in the world of a particular kind of statistical redundancy, which is
characterized by a `Fundamental Hypothesis','' stating that ``Where
instances of a particular collection of intrinsic properties (i.e.,
properties already diagnosed from sensory information) tend to be
grouped such that if some are present, most are, then other useful
properties are likely to exist which generalize over such
instances. Further, properties often are grouped in this way'' (Marr
1970, pp.&nbsp;150-151). These ideas presaged much of the later work by
others on neural network models of brain function, which invoke the
intuition of learning as optimization (``mountain climbing'') in an
underlying probabilistic representation space.

<P>
A model at whose core is the tallying of probabilities of events needs
an extensive memory of a special kind, allowing retrieval based on the
content, rather than the location, of the items. Marr's third
theoretical paper considers the hippocampus as a candidate for
fulfilling this function [<A
 HREF="node1.html#Marr71">Marr, 1971</A>]. In analyzing the memory
capacity and the recall characteristics of the hippocampus, Marr
integrated abstract mathematical (combinatorial) constraints on the
representational capabilities of codons with concrete data derived
from the latest anatomical and electrophysiological studies. The paper
postulated the involvement in learning of synaptic connections
modifiable by experience -- a notion originating with the work of
Donald Hebb in the late 1940's, and discussed by Marr's mentor
Brindley in a 1969 paper. Marr provided a mathematical proof of
efficient partial content-based recall by his model, and offered a
functional interpretation of many anatomical structures in the
hippocampus, along with concrete testable predictions. Many of these
(such as the existence in the hippocampus of experience-modifiable
synapses) were subsequently corroborated (see the reviews in
[<A
 HREF="node1.html#Vaina90">Vaina, 1990</A>]).

<P>
A consummation of this three-pronged effort to develop an integrated
mathematical-neurobiological understanding of the brain would in any
case have earned Marr a prominent place in a gallery, spanning two and
a half centuries (from John Locke to Kenneth Craik), of British
Empiricism, the epistemological stance invariably most popular among
neuroscientists. As it were, having abandoned the high-theory road
soon after the publication of the hippocampus paper, Marr went on to
make his major contribution to the understanding of the brain by
essentially inventing a field and a mode of study: <EM>computational
neuroscience</EM>. By 1972, the focus of his thinking in theoretical
neurobiology shifted away from abstract theories of entire brain
systems, following a realization that without an understanding of
specific tasks and mechanisms -- the issues from which his earlier
theories were ``once removed'' -- any general theory would be
glaringly incomplete.

<P>
Marr first expressed these views in public at an informal workshop on
brain theory, organized in 1972 at the Boston University by Benjamin
Kaminer.  In his opening remarks, he suggested an ``inverse square
law'' for theoretical research, according to which the value of a
study varies inversely with the square of its generality -- an
assessment that favors top-down reasoning anchored in functional
(computational) understanding, along with bottom-up work grounded in
an understanding of the mechanism, but not theories derived from
intuition, or models built on second-hand data.

<P>
The new methodological stance developed by Marr following the shift in
his views is summarized in a remarkably lucid and concise form in a
two-page book review in <EM>Science</EM>, titled ``Approaches to
Biological Information Processing'' [<A
 HREF="node1.html#Marr75">Marr, 1975</A>]. By that time, Marr
came to believe firmly that the field of biological information
processing had not yet accrued an empirical basis sufficient for
guiding and supporting a principled search for a general theory.
Remarking that the brain may turn out to admit ``of no general
theories except ones so unspecific as to have only descriptive and not
predictive powers'' -- a concern echoed in one of his last papers
[<A
 HREF="node1.html#Marr81">Marr, 1981</A>] -- he proceeded to mount a formidable critique of the
most common of the theories circulated in the early 1970s, such as
catastrophe theory and neural nets (the current popularity of
dynamical systems and of connectionism, taken along with the
integration of Marr's critical views into the mainstream theoretical
neurobiology, should fascinate any student of the history of ideas).

<P>
The main grounds for his argument, which was further shaped by an
intensive and fruitful interaction with Tomaso Poggio
[<A
 HREF="node1.html#MarrPoggio77">Marr and Poggio, 1977</A>], were provided by an observation that subsequently
grew into a central legacy of Marr's career: the understanding of any
information processing system is incomplete without insight into the
problems it faces, and without a notion of the form that possible
solutions to these problems can take. Marr and Poggio termed these two
levels of understanding <EM>computational</EM> and <EM>algorithmic</EM>,
placing them above the third, <EM>implementational</EM>, level, which, in
the study of the brain, refers to the neuroanatomy and neurophysiology
of the mechanisms of perception, cognition, and action.

<P>
Upon joining the MIT AI Lab, Marr embarked on a vigorous research
program seeking computational insights into the working of the visual
system, and putting them to the test of implementation as computer
models. Marr's thinking in the transitional stage, at which he treated
computational results on par with neurobiological findings, is
exemplified by the paper on the estimation of lightness in the primate
retina [<A
 HREF="node1.html#Marr74">Marr, 1974</A>]; subsequently, much more weight was given in his
work to top-down, computational-theory considerations. This last
period in Marr's work is epitomized by the theory of binocular
stereopsis, developed in collaboration with Poggio, and presented in a
series of ground-breaking papers [<A
 HREF="node1.html#MarrPoggio76">Marr and Poggio, 1976</A>,<A
 HREF="node1.html#MarrPoggio79">Marr and Poggio, 1979</A>]. At
that time, Marr also worked on low-level image representation
[<A
 HREF="node1.html#Marr76">Marr, 1976</A>,<A
 HREF="node1.html#MarrHild80">Marr and Hildreth, 1980</A>], and on shape and action categorization
[<A
 HREF="node1.html#MarNis78">Marr and Nishihara, 1978</A>,<A
 HREF="node1.html#MarrVaina82">Marr and Vaina, 1982</A>]. Marr's book, <EM>Vision</EM>, written during
the last months of his life, is as much a summary of the views of what
came to be known as the MIT school of computational neuroscience as it
is a personal credo and a list of achievements of the second part of
Marr's scientific endeavor, which lasted from about 1972 to 1980.

<P>
The blend of insight, mathematical rigor, and deep knowledge of
neurobiology that characterizes Marr's work is reminiscent of the
style of such titans of neuroscience as Warren McCulloch -- except
that McCulloch's most lasting results were produced in collaboration
with a mathematician (Walter Pitts), whereas Marr did his own
mathematics. A decade after his quest was cut short, it has been
claimed both that Marr is cited more than he is understood
[<A
 HREF="node1.html#WillshawBuckingham90">Willshaw and Buckingham, 1990</A>], and that his influence permeates
theoretical neurobiology more than what one would guess from counting
citations [<A
 HREF="node1.html#McNaughton90">McNaughton, 1990</A>]. Still, contributors to the mainstream
journals in neurobiology now routinely refer to the ``computations''
carried out by the brain, and the most exciting developments are those
prompted (or at least accompanied) by computational theories.

<P>
In computer vision (a branch of artificial intelligence), the
influence of Marr's ideas has been complicated by the dominance of the
top-down interpretation of his methodology: proceeding from a notion of
what needs to be done towards the possible solutions. For some time,
Marr's school was identified there with the adherents of a particular
computational theory of vision, which claims that constructing an
internal model of the world is a prerequisite for carrying out any
visual task. The accumulation of findings to the contrary in
neurobiology and in the behavioral sciences gradually brought to the
fore the possibility that vision does not require geometric
reconstruction. This encouraged researchers to seek alternative
theories, some of which employ concepts and techniques that
did not exist in the 1970s, or were not known to the scholars of
vision at the time. These new ideas, in turn, are making their way
into neuroscience, as envisaged by Marr.

<P>
On a more general level, Marr's work provided a solid proof that a
good theory in behavior and brain sciences need not have to trade off
mathematical rigor for faithfulness to specific findings. More
importantly, it emphasized the role of explanation over and above mere
curve fitting, making it legitimate to ask <EM>why</EM> a particular
brain process is taking place, and not merely what differential
equation can describe it.
