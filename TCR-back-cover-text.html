  This book is about all things consciousness, great and small. It
  starts by pointing to the key characteristic of consciousness,
  without realizing which it cannot be understood: like everything
  else about the mind, it is fundamentally a kind of computation.
  Among many other matters, this explains: how it is that we share
  some aspects of consciousness with bacteria; how it can arise in
  artificial machines and not just living ones; how the empty cocoon
  of the self that it spins ends up pretending to be the butterfly;
  and how consciousness dooms this virtual butterfly to the splendor
  and the suffering of being awake and aware. Unlike most other books
  on consciousness, this one includes a discussion of some possible
  ways whereby we, pinned like butterflies by our species’ history and
  socioeconomic circumstances, can awake to our collective predicament
  and join forces to do something about it. It should be of interest
  to all readers who care about the nature of our lived experience —
  and about our shared fate, which depends on developing critical
  consciousness of our dire situation and the social dynamics that has
  led to it.
