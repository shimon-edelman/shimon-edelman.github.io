"Then I looked around to find out where I was. The surroundings were unknown
 to me. I thought that the ally must have taken me through the air and
 dumped me somewhere very far from the place where we started to spin. I
 oriented myself. I thought that my home must be towards the east, so I
 began to walk in that direction. It was still early. The encounter with the
 ally had not taken too long. Very soon I found a trail and then I saw a
 bunch of men and women coming towards me. They were Indians. I thought they
 were Mazatec Indians. They surrounded me and asked me where I was
 going. 'I'm going home to Ixtlan,' I said to them. 'Are you lost?' someone
 asked. 'I am,' I said. 'Why?'  'Because Ixtlan is not that way. Ixtlan is
 in the opposite direction. We ourselves are going there,' someone else
 said."
