  <DT>Assignment 1 (due Nov. 22):</DT>
  <DD><P>
       Write a simple regularized stereo matcher, in Matlab. The program should
       read in a pair of images, and compute a disparity field optimizing the
       match between the two images and a measure of smoothness of the disparities.
       Test the program on the stereo pair available via ftp 
       (<A HREF="ftp://ftp.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/pub/edelman/ball-1-1.gif">left</A>
       and
       <A HREF="ftp://ftp.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/pub/edelman/ball-1-2.gif">right</A>
       images, both in GIF format; set the Options menu in Mosaic to <I>"Load to
       local disk"</I> if you wish to download the images rather than see them on
       the screen). Submit the program, the output, and a short discussion of your
       approach and results. Compare your approach with the one described in an
       upcoming CVGIP paper,
       <a href="ftp://ftp.nj.nec.com/pub/ingemar/papers/cvgip.ps.Z">
       A Maximum Likelihood Stereo Algorithm </a> from NEC Research.
       <P> NOTE: make use of the optimization and the
       image processing toolboxes in Matlab. For example, you can run the matching
       algorithm after extracting the intensity edges in the original images.
       To find an appropriate built-in function in Matlab, use the "lookfor"
       and the "help" commands.
       </P></DD>
       
  <DT>Assignment 2 (due Dec. 22):</DT>
  <DD><P>
       Write a neural-network surface interpolator that would take a
       set of disparities at discrete points (either artificially created,
       or obtained with a stereo matcher), and produce a surface passing
       through or near the points. Compare multilayer perceptrons, available
       as a part of the Neural Network toolbox in Matlab, or some other
       method of your choice, with the surface interpolation functions
       built into Matlab.
       <P> Make your program
       general enough so that it can be applied to multidimensional function
       approximation. Test it on a number of artificial examples of your
       choice. Describe the performance of the program for different ratios
       of the number of examples to the number of dimensions and the number
       of weights in the network.
       <P>
       A textbook on neural networks is available online <A HREF="ftp://ftp.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/pub/edelman/neuro-intro.300.ps.Z">here</A>. Check out
       <A HREF="http://www.neuronet.ph.kcl.ac.uk/">this</A> URL for more on neural nets.
       
       </P></DD>

  <DT>Assignment 3 (due Jan. 22):</DT>
  <DD><P>
       State any formalization of your choice for the problem of learning a
       visual representation within the PAC framework (there is no need to
       prove theorems, but please make the <I>statement</I> formal); compare with the
       <I>k</I>-inaccurate copy, defined in the lecture notes; discuss
       advantages and disadvantages, applicability to real-world problems.
       <P>
       If you are interested in machine learning, have a look at the
       <A HREF="http://www.cs.cmu.edu:8001/afs/cs.cmu.edu/user/avrim/www/ML94/courseinfo.html">notes</A> (handouts and slides) for a course held at CMU last fall.
