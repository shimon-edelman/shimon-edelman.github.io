    Learning names for categories can be modeled as Bayesian inference
    over a tree-structured domain representation. <small>Objects are
    placed at the leaves of the tree; hypotheses about categories that
    words could label correspond to different nodes. Nodes at
    different depths pick out hypotheses at different levels of

  <P>
    <I>Likelihoods</I> [of images, given labels] assume that examples
    are drawn randomly from the node labeled by the word, favoring

    <a href="Bayesian-suspicious-coincidences.html"
       target=new><I><B>suspicious coincidence</B></I></a>: it would
       be very improbable — suspicious — for all examples of a word to

    actually labels a high node.)

  <P>
    <I>Posterior probabilities</I> [of labels, given images] are

  A Hierarchical Bayesian model for learning an abstract theory of
  causality.
  <P>
  At the highest level are laws expressed in first-order logic
  representing the abstract properties of causal relationships, the role of
  exogenous interventions in defining the direction of causality, and
  features that may mark an event as an exogenous intervention. These laws
  place constraints on possible directed graphical models at the level
  below, which in turn are used to explain patterns of observed events over
  variables. Given observed events from several different causal systems,
  each encoded in a distinct data matrix, and a hypothesis space of possible
  laws at the highest level, the model converges quickly on a correct theory
  of intervention-based causality and uses that theory to constrain
  inferences about the specific causal networks underlying the different
  systems at the level below.

    <blockquote>
      "A major proposition of Marxian educational theory is that the
      educational system in advanced capitalist societies is a
      mechanism for the reproduction of the social division of labor.
      This paper deals with one aspect of the reproduction process:
      the <I>legitimation</I> of the division of labor and the process
      of assigning individuals to its various positions. We say that a
      social process is legitimated when individuals are sufficiently
      convinced of its inevitability, desirability, or justness that
      united class action towards the transformation of the process is
      rendered infeasible. Thus the apparent legitimacy of social
      relationships is one, but clearly not the only, basis of the
