  onto a 1-dimensional subspace (a line) amounts to multiplying the vector's elements by
  individual weights that define the line's orientation and then summing the
  results &#151; just like the computation that neurons carry out:
  $$
  x = [a,b,c,d] \cdot [p_1,p_2,p_3,p_4] = a p_1+b p_2+c p_3+d p_4

  <h1>[Tolman's concluding remarks from that paper]</h1>

  "Narrow strip maps rather than broad comprehensive maps seem to be
  induced: (1) by a damaged brain, (2) by an inadequate array of
  environmentally presented cues, (3) by an overdose of repetitions on the
  original trained-on path and (4) by the presence of too strongly
  motivational or of too strongly frustrating conditions.
  <P>
  Over and over again men are blinded by too violent motivations and too
  intense frustrations into blind and unintelligent and in the end
  desperately dangerous hates of outsiders. And the expression of these their
  displaced hates ranges all the way from discrimination against minorities
  to world conflagrations.
  <P>
  What is the name of Heaven and Psychology can we do about it? My only
  answer is to preach again the virtues of reason — of, that is, broad
  cognitive maps. And to suggest that the child-trainers and the
  world-planners of the future can only, if at all, bring about the presence
  of the required rationality (i.e., comprehensive maps) if they see to it
  that nobody's children are too over-motivated or too frustrated. Only then
  can these children learn to look before and after, learn to see that there
  are often round-about and safer paths to their quite proper goals — learn,
  that is, to realize that the well-beings of White and of Negro, of Catholic
  and of Protestant, of Christian and of Jew, of American and of Russian (and
  even of males and females) are mutually interdependent. 
  <P>
  We dare not let ourselves or others become so over-emotional, so hungry,
  so ill-clad, so over-motivated that only narrow strip-maps will be
  developed. All of us in Europe as well as in America, in the Orient as well
  as in the Occident, must be made calm enough and well-fed enough to be able
  to develop truly comprehensive maps [...].
  <!-- or, as Freud would have put it, to be
  able to learn to live according to the Reality Principle rather than
  according to the too narrow and too immediate Pleasure Principle. -->
  <P>
  We must, in short, subject our children and ourselves (as the kindly
  experimenter would his rats) to the optimal conditions of moderate
  motivation and of an absence of unnecessary frustrations, whenever we put
  them and ourselves before that great God-given maze which is our human
  world. I cannot predict whether or not we will be able, or be allowed, to
  do this; but I <I>can</I> say that, only insofar as we <I>are</I> able and are allowed,
  have we cause for hope."
