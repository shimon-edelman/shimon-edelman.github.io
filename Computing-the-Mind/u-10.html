  <h1>(II) what language is like: two complementary computational aspects</h1>

  <P>
  <BR>
    The problem of serial order in behavior, as formulated by Lashley
    (1951), contains, upon reflection, two complementary aspects: 
    
    <ul>
      <li>The STRUCTURAL or SYNCHRONIC aspect: how to deal with
	multiple input and/or output variables, specified at a given
	instant of time.  Hence the computational problem
	of <B>multimodality</B>: embodied agents must 
	deal with multiple streams of information (multiple sensors &
	actuators), which, moreover, may differ radically in their
	statistical and other properties (e.g., auditory vs. visual
	cues).
      </li>
      <li>
	The TEMPORAL or DIACHRONIC aspect: how to deal with multiple
	streams of information as they unfold over time.  Hence the
	computational problem of 
	<B>concurrency</B>: the dynamical processes that affect / comprise
	behavior not only unfold in parallel: they generally do so at
	different rates and independently, or asynchronously, with
	regard to each other.
      </li>

      [...] The grammatical possibilities of a language are like a
      network of paths in open grassland. There are a number of heavily
      used, wide and well-beaten tracks. Other, less popular routes are
      narrower, and the variation extends smoothly down to routes used only
      very occasionally, which are barely distinguishable furrows or, if
      they are used rarely enough, perhaps not even visible as permanent
      marks in the grass; but there are no fences anywhere preventing any
      particular route being used, and there is no sharp discontinuity akin
      to the contrast between metalled roads and foot-made paths.

  <img src="Trotsky-and-Breton.jpg" height=250 class="figure-right">
  <P>
  On the standard [formalist / functionalist] account, to know language means
  to possess a GRAMMAR — a system of formal rules that (i) generate (all
  and only well-formed) sentences and that (ii) support parsing of
  sentences into their constituents.

  <P>
    <HR>

  An alternative theory that is gaining ascendance posits

  through statistical inference.

  <img src="language-Jedi-mind-trick.png" class="figure-right"

  <P>
  <BR>
  The radical (and, I think, correct) view is that constructions form
  a TOOLKIT for INFLUENCING other people's thinking and behavior (as
  well as one's own). 
  <P class="incremental">
    To know language means to have mastery of a toolkit that allows
    one to influence behavior and thinking, of others and of self.

<DIV CLASS="slide">
  <h1>(III) what it means to know language:  the core computational problem</h1>

  <P>
  <BR>
  The general computational problem implied by the above
  characteristics is that of control. The need for control is
  universal in the animal kingdom; as Savage-Rumbaugh and Lewin (1994)
  put it: “All organisms with complex nervous systems are faced with
  the moment-by-moment question that is posed by life: what shall I do
  next?” 
  <P>
  Language behaviors reside in a graph-like space of sequences of
  multimodal gestures that embody a game of influence between
  interlocutors and that are subject to multiple, dynamically changing
  influences and contextual constraints. THIS IS THE SPACE THAT NEEDS
  TO BE LEARNED.
  <P>
  The ultimate problem of control in language is, however, the same as
  in any other behavior: whereas its general formulation is “What
  shall I do next?”, in language it becomes “What shall I say [and do]
  next?”. Thus, insofar as it requires choosing a course of action,
  behavioral control is always an exercise in navigation: “Where, in
  the space of possible choices, should I go?”
